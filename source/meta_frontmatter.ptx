    <title> Preface: OpenStax Calculus Volume 1 </title>
    <p id="fs-idm443119440">Welcome to <em>Calculus Volume 1</em>, an OpenStax resource. This textbook was written to increase student access to high-quality learning materials, maintaining highest standards of academic rigor at little to no cost. </p>
    <section id="eip-43"><title>About OpenStax</title><p id="eip-320">OpenStax is a nonprofit based at Rice University, and it’s our mission to improve student access to education. Our first openly licensed college textbook was published in 2012, and our library has since scaled to over 25 books for college and AP<registered/> courses used by hundreds of thousands of students. OpenStax Tutor, our low-cost personalized learning tool, is being used in college courses throughout the country.  Through our partnerships with philanthropic foundations and our alliance with other educational resource organizations, OpenStax is breaking down the most common barriers to learning and empowering students and instructors to succeed.</p>

    <section id="eip-717"><title>About <em>Calculus Volume 1</em></title><p id="eip-35">Calculus is designed for the typical two- or three-semester general calculus course, incorporating innovative features to enhance student learning. The book guides students through the core concepts of calculus and helps them understand how those concepts apply to their lives and the world around them. Due to the comprehensive nature of the material, we are offering the book in three volumes for flexibility and efficiency. Volume 1 covers functions, limits, derivatives, and integration.</p>
      <subsection id="eip-576"><title>Coverage and scope</title><p id="eip-21">Our <em>Calculus Volume 1</em> textbook adheres to the scope and sequence of most general calculus courses nationwide. We have worked to make calculus interesting and accessible to students while maintaining the mathematical rigor inherent in the subject. With this objective in mind, the content of the three volumes of <em>Calculus</em> have been developed and arranged to provide a logical progression from fundamental to more advanced concepts, building upon what students have already learned and emphasizing connections between topics and between theory and applications. The goal of each section is to enable students not just to recognize concepts, but work with them in ways that will be useful in later courses and future careers. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from mathematics educators dedicated to the project.</p>

  <subsection id="eip-56"><title>Pedagogical foundation</title><p id="eip-377">Throughout <em>Calculus Volume 1</em> you will find examples and exercises that present classical ideas and techniques as well as modern applications and methods. Derivations and explanations are based on years of classroom experience on the part of long-time calculus professors, striving for a balance of clarity and rigor that has proven successful with their students. Motivational applications cover important topics in probability, biology, ecology, business, and economics, as well as areas of physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science. <em>Student Projects</em> in each chapter give students opportunities to explore interesting sidelights in pure and applied mathematics, from determining a safe distance between the grandstand and the track at a Formula One racetrack, to calculating the center of mass of the Grand Canyon Skywalk or the terminal speed of a skydiver. <em>Chapter Opening Applications</em> pose problems that are solved later in the chapter, using the ideas covered in that chapter. Problems include the hydraulic force against the Hoover Dam, and the comparison of relative intensity of two earthquakes. <em>Definitions, Rules,</em> and <em>Theorems</em> are highlighted throughout the text, including over 60 <em>Proofs</em> of theorems.
  </p></subsection><subsection id="eip-694"><title>Assessments that reinforce key concepts </title><p id="eip-385">In-chapter <em>Examples</em> walk students through problems by posing a question, stepping out a solution, and then asking students to practice the skill with a “Checkpoint” question. The book also includes assessments at the end of each chapter so students can apply what they’ve learned through practice problems. Many exercises are marked with a <em>[T]</em> to indicate they are suitable for solution by technology, including calculators or Computer Algebra Systems (CAS). Answers for selected exercises are available in the <em>Answer Key</em> at the back of the book. The book also includes assessments at the end of each chapter so students can apply what they’ve learned through practice problems.
  </p></subsection><subsection id="eip-333"><title>Early or late transcendentals</title><p id="eip-963">
  <em>Calculus Volume 1</em> is designed to accommodate both Early and Late Transcendental approaches to calculus. Exponential and logarithmic functions are introduced informally in Chapter 1 and presented in more rigorous terms in Chapter 6. Differentiation and integration of these functions is covered in Chapters 3–5 for instructors who want to include them with other types of functions. These discussions, however, are in separate sections that can be skipped for instructors who prefer to wait until the integral definitions are given before teaching the calculus derivations of exponentials and logarithms.
  </p></subsection><subsection id="eip-323"><title>Comprehensive art program</title><p id="eip-683">
  Our art program is designed to enhance students’ understanding of concepts through clear and effective illustrations, diagrams, and photographs.

  OpenStax partners with the Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education (ISKME) to offer Community Hubs on OER Commons – a platform for instructors to share community-created resources that support OpenStax books, free of charge. Through our Community Hubs, instructors can upload their own materials or download resources to use in their own courses, including additional ancillaries, teaching material, multimedia, and relevant course content. We encourage instructors to join the hubs for the subjects most relevant to your teaching and research as an opportunity both to enrich your courses and to engage with other faculty.
