  <p id="fs-id1170573571117">We have studied the general characteristics of functions, so now let's examine some specific classes of functions. We begin by reviewing the basic properties of linear and quadratic functions, and then generalize to include higher-degree polynomials. By combining root functions with polynomials, we can define general algebraic functions and distinguish them from the transcendental functions we examine later in this chapter. We finish the section with examples of piecewise-defined functions and take a look at how to sketch the graph of a function that has been shifted, stretched, or reflected from its initial form.</p>

    <title>Linear Functions and Slope</title>
    <p id="fs-id1170573418050">The easiest type of function to consider is a <term>linear function</term>. Linear functions have the form <m>f(x)=ax+b,</m> where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are constants. In <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_01_02_001"/>, we see examples of linear functions when <m>a</m> is positive, negative, and zero. Note that if <m>a\gt  0 ,</m> the graph of the line rises as <m>x</m> increases. In other words, <m>f(x)=ax+b</m> is increasing on <m>(-\infty,\infty).</m> If <m>a\lt  0 ,</m> the graph of the line falls as <m>x</m> increases. In this case, <m>f(x)=ax+b</m> is decreasing on <m>(-\infty,\infty).</m> If <m>a= 0 ,</m> the line is horizontal.</p>

    <description>"An image of a graph. The y axis runs from -2 to 5 and the x axis runs from -2 to 5. The graph is of the 3 functions. The first function is &#x201C;f(x) = 3x + 1&#x201D;, which is an increasing straight line with an x intercept at ((-1/3), 0) and a y intercept at (0, 1). The second function is &#x201C;g(x) = 2&#x201D;, which is a horizontal line with a y intercept at (0, 2) and no x intercept. The third function is &#x201C;h(x) = (-1/2)x&#x201D;, which is a decreasing straight line with an x intercept and y intercept both at the origin. The function f(x) is increasing at a higher rate than the function h(x) is decreasing."

    <p id="fs-id1170573396917">As suggested by <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_01_02_001"/>, the graph of any linear function is a line. One of the distinguishing features of a line is its slope. The <term>slope</term> is the change in <m>y</m> for each unit change in <m>x.</m> The slope measures both the steepness and the direction of a line. If the slope is positive, the line points upward when moving from left to right. If the slope is negative, the line points downward when moving from left to right. If the slope is zero, the line is horizontal. To calculate the slope of a line, we need to determine the ratio of the change in <m>y</m> versus the change in <m>x.</m> To do so, we choose any two points <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m> on the line and calculate <m>\frac{y_2−y_1}{x_2−x_1}.</m> In <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_01_02_002"/>, we see this ratio is independent of the points chosen.</p>

    <p id="fs-id1170573306278">We now examine the relationship between slope and the formula for a linear function. Consider the linear function given by the formula <m>f(x)=ax+b.</m> As discussed earlier, we know the graph of a linear function is given by a line. We can use our definition of slope to calculate the slope of this line. As shown, we can determine the slope by calculating <m>(y_2−y_1) /(x_2−x_1)</m> for any points <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m> on the line. Evaluating the function <m>f</m> at <m>x= 0 ,</m> we see that <m>( 0 ,b)</m> is a point on this line. Evaluating this function at <m>x= 1 ,</m> we see that <m>( 1 ,a+b)</m> is also a point on this line. Therefore, the slope of this line is</p>
    <me><!-- Edit FRAC!--> \frac{(a+b)−b}{1 − 0}=a.</me>
    <p id="fs-id1170573409038">We have shown that the coefficient <m>a</m> is the slope of the line. We can conclude that the formula <m>f(x)=ax+b</m> describes a line with slope <m>a.</m> Furthermore, because this line intersects the <m>y</m>-axis at the point <m>( 0 ,b),</m> we see that the <m>y</m>-intercept for this linear function is <m>( 0 ,b).</m> We conclude that the formula <m>f(x)=ax+b</m> tells us the slope, <m>a,</m> and the <m>y</m>-intercept, <m>( 0 ,b),</m> for this line. Since we often use the symbol <m> m </m> to denote the slope of a line, we can write</p>

    <p id="fs-id1170573381114">Sometimes it is convenient to express a linear function in different ways. For example, suppose the graph of a linear function passes through the point <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and the slope of the line is <m>m.</m> Since any other point <m>(x,f(x))</m> on the graph of <m>f</m> must satisfy the equation</p>

    <me>f(x)−y_1=m(x−x_1).</me>
    <p id="fs-id1170573309782">We call this equation the <term>point-slope equation</term> for that linear function.</p>
    <p id="fs-id1170573309900">Since every nonvertical line is the graph of a linear function, the points on a nonvertical line can be described using the slope-intercept or point-slope equations. However, a vertical line does not represent the graph of a function and cannot be expressed in either of these forms. Instead, a vertical line is described by the equation <m>x=k</m> for some constant <m>k.</m> Since neither the slope-intercept form nor the point-slope form allows for vertical lines, we use the notation</p>

  <title>Behavior at Infinity</title>
  <p id="fs-id1170573502627">To determine the behavior of a function <m>f</m> as the inputs approach infinity, we look at the values <m>f(x)</m> as the inputs, <m>x,</m> become larger. For some functions, the values of <m>f(x)</m> approach a finite number. For example, for the function <m>f(x)= 2 + 1  /x,</m> the values <m> 1  /x</m> become closer and closer to zero for all values of <m>x</m> as they get larger and larger. For this function, we say "<m>f(x)</m> approaches two as <m>x</m> goes to infinity,"" and we write <m>f(x)\to  2 </m> as <m>x\to \infty.</m> The line <m>y= 2 </m> is a horizontal asymptote for the function <m>f(x)= 2 + 1  /x</m> because the graph of the function gets closer to the line as <m>x</m> gets larger.</p>
  <p id="fs-id1170573412596">For other functions, the values <m>f(x)</m> may not approach a finite number but instead may become larger for all values of <m>x</m> as they get larger.

We can conclude that the function <m>f(x)= 3 x^2 </m> approaches infinity as <m>x</m> approaches infinity, and we write <m> 3 x^2 \to \infty</m> as<m>x\to \infty.</m> The behavior as <m>x\to -\infty</m> and the meaning of <m>f(x)\to -\infty</m> as <m>x\to \infty</m> or <m>x\to -\infty</m> can be defined similarly.

  <p id="fs-id1170573362412">To understand the end behavior for polynomial functions, we can focus on quadratic and cubic functions.

  <title>Algebraic Functions</title>

An <term>algebraic function</term> is one that involves addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, rational powers, and roots. Two types of algebraic functions are rational functions and root functions.</p>
  <p id="fs-id1170573420004">Just as rational numbers are quotients of integers, rational functions are quotients of polynomials. In particular, a <term>rational function</term> is any function of the form <m>f(x)=p(x) /q(x),</m> where <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> are polynomials. For example,</p>
  <me>f(x)= \frac{ 3 x− 1}{  5 x+ 2 } \text{ and } g(x)=\frac{ 4}{x^2 + 1 }</me>
  <p id="fs-id1170573362465">are rational functions. A <term>root function</term> is a power function of the form <m>f(x)= x^{1/n},</m> where <m>n</m> is a positive integer greater than one.

  <description>"An image of a graph. The x axis runs from -7 to 7 and a y axis runs from -7 to 7. The graph contains four functions. The first function is &#x201C;f(x) = absolute value of x&#x201D; and is labeled starting function. It decreases in a straight line until the origin and then increases in a straight line again after the origin. The second function is &#x201C;f(x) = absolute value of (x + 2)&#x201D;, which decreases in a straight line until the point (-2, 0) and then increases in a straight line again after the point (-2, 0). The second function is the same shape as the first function, but is shifted left 2 units. The third function is &#x201C;f(x) = -(absolute value of (x + 2))&#x201D;, which increases in a straight line until the point (-2, 0) and then decreases in a straight line again after the point (-2, 0). The third function is the second function reflected about the x axis. The fourth function is &#x201C;f(x) = -(absolute value of (x + 2)) - 3&#x201D; and is labeled &#x201C;transformed function&#x201D;. It increases in a straight line until the point (-2, -3) and then decreases in a straight line again after the point (-2, -3). The fourth function is the third function shifted down 3 units."

  <description>"An image of a graph. The x axis runs from -7 to 7 and a y axis runs from -2 to 10. The graph contains four functions. The first function is &#x201C;f(x) = square root of x&#x201D; and is labeled starting function. It is a curved function that begins at the origin and increases. The second function is &#x201C;f(x) = square root of -x&#x201D;, which is a curved function that decreases until it reaches the origin, where it stops. The second function is the first function reflected about the y axis. The third function is &#x201C;f(x) = 3(square root of -x)&#x201D;, which is a curved function that decreases until it reaches the origin, where it stops. The third function decreases at a quicker rate than the second function. The fourth function is &#x201C;f(x) = 3(square root of -x) + 1&#x201D; and is labeled &#x201C;transformed function&#x201D;. Itis a curved function that decreases until it reaches the point (0, 1), where it stops. The fourth function is the third function shifted up 1 unit."

  <ul id="fs-id1170573581308" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
  <li>The power function <m>f(x)=x^n</m> is an even function if <m>n</m> is even and <m>n\neq  0 ,</m> and it is an odd function if <m>n</m> is odd.</li>
  <li>The root function <m>f(x)=x^{1/n}</m> has the domain <m>[ 0 ,\infty)</m> if <m>n</m> is even and the domain <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m> if <m>n</m> is odd. If <m>n</m> is odd, then <m>f(x)= x^{1/n}</m> is an odd function.</li>
  <li>The domain of the rational function <m>f(x)=p(x) /q(x),</m> where <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> are polynomial functions, is the set of <m>x</m> such that <m>q(x)\neq  0 .</m></li>
  <li>Functions that involve the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and powers are algebraic functions. All other functions are transcendental. Trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions are examples of transcendental functions.</li>
  <li>A polynomial function <m>f</m> with degree <m>n\geq  1 </m> satisfies <m>f(x)\to \pm\infty</m> as <m>x\to \pm\infty.</m> The sign of the output as <m>x\to \infty</m> depends on the sign of the leading coefficient only and on whether <m>n</m> is even or odd.</li>
  <li>Vertical and horizontal shifts, vertical and horizontal scalings, and reflections about the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes are examples of transformations of functions.</li>
