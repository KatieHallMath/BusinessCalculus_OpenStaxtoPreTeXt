<p id="fs-id1169739111246">In this section we look at some applications of the derivative by focusing on the interpretation of the derivative as the rate of change of a function. These applications include <term>acceleration</term> and velocity in physics, <term>population growth rates</term> in biology, and marginal functions in economics.</p>
</introduction>
<subsection id="fs-id1169739031094">
<title>Amount of Change Formula</title>
<p id="fs-id1169739001719">One application for derivatives is to estimate an unknown value of a function at a point by using a known value of a function at some given point together with its rate of change at the given point. If <m>f(x)</m> is a function defined on an interval <m>[a,a+h],</m> then the <term>amount of change</term> of <m>f(x)</m> over the interval is the change in the <m>y</m> values of the function over that interval and is given by</p>
<me>f(a+h)-f(a).</me>
<p id="fs-id1169739019267">The <term>average rate of change</term> of the function <m>f</m> over that same interval is the ratio of the amount of change over that interval to the corresponding change in the <m>x</m> values. It is given by</p>
<me>\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</me>
<p id="fs-id1169738865347">As we already know, the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>a</m> is its derivative</p>
<me>f'(a)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</me>
<p id="fs-id1169739038407">For small enough values of <m>h,f'(a)\approx \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</m> We can then solve for <m>f(a+h)</m> to get the amount of change formula:</p>
<men xml:id="fs-id1169739034265">f(a+h)\approx f(a)+f'(a)h.</men>
<p id="fs-id1169738850663">We can use this formula if we know only <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f'(a)</m> and wish to estimate the value of <m>f(a+h).</m> For example, we may use the current population of a city and the rate at which it is growing to estimate its population in the near future. As we can see in <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_03_04_001"/>, we are approximating <m>f(a+h)</m> by the <m>y</m> coordinate at <m>a+h</m> on the line tangent to <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=a.</m> Observe that the accuracy of this estimate depends on the value of <m>h</m> as well as the value of <m>f'(a).</m></p>

A straight line is drawn through (a, f(a)) with its slope being the derivative at that point. This straight line passes through (a + h, f(a) + f’(a)h). There is a line segment connecting (a + h, f(a + h)) and (a + h, f(a) + f’(a)h), and it is marked that this is the error in using f(a) + f’(a)h to estimate f(a + h).">

The concept of a marginal function is common in the fields of business and economics and implies the use of derivatives. The marginal cost is the derivative of the cost function.
