     <p>In this section, we provide a formal definition of a function and examine several ways in which functions are represented—namely, through tables, formulas, and graphs. We study formal notation and terms related to functions. We also define composition of functions and symmetry properties. Most of this material will be a review for you, but it serves as a handy reference to remind you of some of the algebraic techniques useful for working with functions.

    <title>Functions</title>
    <p>
      Given two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, a set with elements that are ordered pairs <m> (x,y) </m> where <m>x</m> is an element of <m>A</m> and <m>y</m>
 is an element of <m>B</m>, is a relation from <m>A</m>   to <m>B</m>. A relation from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>
 defines a relationship between those two sets. A function is a special type of relation in which each element of the first set is related to exactly one element of the second set. The element of the first set is called the <em>input</em>; the element of the second set is called the <em>output</em>. Functions are used all the time in mathematics to describe relationships between two sets. For any function, when we know the input, the output is determined, so we say that the output is a function of the input. For example, the area of a square is determined by its side length, so we say that the area (the output) is a function of its side length (the input). The velocity of a ball thrown in the air can be described as a function of the amount of time the ball is in the air. The cost of mailing a package is a function of the weight of the package. Since functions have so many uses, it is important to have precise definitions and terminology to study them.
    </p>

    <definition>
      A <term>function</term> <m>f</m> consists of a set of inputs, a set of outputs, and a rule for assigning each input to exactly one
      output. The set of inputs is called the <term>domain</term> of the function. The set of outputs is called the <term> range </term>
      of the function.
    </definition>


    <p>
      For example, consider the function <m>f</m>, where the domain is the set of all real numbers and the rule is to square the input. Then, the input <m>x=3</m> is assigned to the output <m>3^2=9</m>.

       Since every nonnegative real number has a real-value square root, every nonnegative number is an element of the range of this function. Since there is no real number with a square that is negative, the negative real numbers are not elements of the range. We conclude that the range is the set of nonnegative real numbers.

      For a general function <m>f</m> with domain <m>D</m>, we often use <m>x</m> to denote the input and <m>y</m> to denote the output associated with <m>x</m>.
      When doing so, we refer to <m>x</m> as the <term>independent variable</term> and <m>y</m> as the <term>dependent variable</term>, because it depends on <m>x</m>.

       Using function notation, we write <m>y=f(x)</m> and we read this equation as “<m>y</m> equals <m>f</m> of <m>x</m>.”

       For the squaring function described earlier, we write <m> f(x)=x^2.</m> </p>

        <p> The concept of a function can be visualized using <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_01_01_001">Figure </xref>, <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_01_01_002">Figure </xref> and <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_01_01_003"> Figures </xref>. </p><!-- [\[link\]](#CNX_Calc_Figure_01_01_001), [\[link\]](#CNX_Calc_Figure_01_01_002), and [\[link\]](#CNX_Calc_Figure_01_01_003).

      <p id="fs-id1170572133251">We can also visualize a function by plotting points <m>(x,y)</m> in the coordinate plane where <m> y=f(x)</m>. The <term>graph of a function</term> is the set of all these points. For example, consider the function <m>f</m> where the domain is the set <m>D=\{1,2,3\}</m> and the rule is <m> f(x)=3-x.</m> In <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_01_01_004">Figure </xref>, we plot a graph of this function.</p>

      <p id="fs-id1170572280787">Every function has a domain. However, sometimes a function is described by an equation, as in <m>f(x)=x^2,</m> with no specific domain given. In this case, the domain is taken to be the set of all real numbers <m>x</m> for which <m>f(x)</m> is a real number. For example, since any real number can be squared, if no other domain is specified, we consider the domain of <m>f(x)=x^2</m> to be the set of all real numbers. On the other hand, the square root function <m>f(x)=\sqrt{x}</m> only gives a real output if <m>x</m> is nonnegative. Therefore, the domain of the function <m>f(x)=\sqrt{x}</m> is the set of nonnegative real numbers, sometimes called the <term> natural domain</term>.</p>

      <p id="fs-id1170572163630">For the functions <m>f(x)=x^2</m> and <m>f(x)=\sqrt{x},</m> the domains are sets with an infinite number of elements. Clearly we cannot list all these elements. When describing a set with an infinite number of elements, it is often helpful to use set-builder or interval notation. When using set-builder notation to describe a subset of all real numbers, denoted <m>\mathbb{R}],</m> we write</p>
      <me>\{x|x \text{ has some property} \}.</me>
      <p id="fs-id1170572209639">We read this as the set of real numbers <m>x</m> such that <m>x</m> has some property. For example, if we were interested in the set of real numbers that are greater than one but less than five, we could denote this set using set-builder notation by writing</p>
      <me>\{x | 1 &lt; x &lt; 5 \}.</me>

      <p id="fs-id1170572225804">A set such as this, which contains all numbers greater than <m>a</m> and less than <m>b,</m> can also be denoted using the <term>interval notation</term> <m>(a,b).</m> Therefore,</p>
      <m>(1,5)=\{x| 1\lt x \lt 5\}.</m>
      <p id="fs-id1170573392876">The numbers <m>1</m> and <m>5</m> are called the <term>endpoints</term> of this set. If we want to consider the set that includes the endpoints, we would denote this set by writing</p>
      <me>[1,5]=\{x|1\leq x\leq5\}.</me>
      <p id="fs-id1170572181683">We can use similar notation if we want to include one of the endpoints, but not the other. To denote the set of nonnegative real numbers, we would use the set-builder notation</p>
      <me>\{x|0\leq x\}.</me>
      <p id="fs-id1170572130057">The smallest number in this set is zero, but this set does not have a largest number. Using interval notation, we would use the symbol <m>\infty ,</m> which refers to positive infinity, and we would write the set as</p>
      <me>[0,\infty)=\{x|0 \leq x\}.</me>
      <p id="fs-id1170572107282">It is important to note that <m>\infty</m> is not a real number. It is used symbolically here to indicate that this set includes all real numbers greater than or equal to zero. Similarly, if we wanted to describe the set of all nonpositive numbers, we could write</p>
      <me>(-\infty,0]=\{x|x \leq 0\}.</me>
      <p id="fs-id1170572168622">Here, the notation <m>-\infty</m> refers to negative infinity, and it indicates that we are including all numbers less than or equal to zero, no matter how small. The set</p>
      <me>(-\infty,\infty)=\{x|x \text{ is any real number }\}</me>
      <p id="fs-id1170572482419">refers to the set of all real numbers.</p>

      <p id="fs-id1170572150626">Some functions are defined using different equations for different parts of their domain. These types of functions are known as <term>piecewise-defined functions</term>. For example, suppose we want to define a function <m>f</m> with a domain that is the set of all real numbers such that <m>f(x)=3x+1</m> for <m>x \geq 2</m> and <m>f(x)=x^2</m> for <m>x &lt; 2.</m> We denote this function by writing</p>
      <me>f(x)=\begin{cases} 3x+1 \amp x \geq 2 \\ x^2 \amp x &lt; 2 .\end{cases}</me>
      <p id="fs-id1170572129919">When evaluating this function for an input <m>x,</m> the equation to use depends on whether <m>x \geq 2</m> or <m>x &lt; 2.</m> For example, since <m>5 \ge 2,</m> we use the fact that <m>f(x)=3x+1</m> for <m>x \geq 2</m> and see that <m>f(5)=3(5)+1=16.</m> On the other hand, for <m>x=-1,</m> we use the fact that <m>f(x)=x^2</m> for <m>x &lt; 2</m> and see that <m>f(-1)=1.</m></p>

    <li><p> Consider <m>f(x)=(x-4)^2+5.</m> </p>
    <ol id="fs-id1170572133213">
    <li>Since <m>f(x)=(x-4)^2+5</m> is a real number for any real number <m>x,</m> the domain of <m>f</m> is the interval <m>(-\infty, \infty).</m></li>
    <li>Since <m>(x-4)^2 \geq 0,</m> we know <m>f(x)=(x-4)^2+5 \geq 5.</m> Therefore, the range must be a subset of <m>\{y|y \geq 5\}.</m> To show that every element in this set is in the range, we need to show that for a given <m>y</m> in that set, there is a real number <m>x</m> such that <m>f(x)=(x-4)^2+5=y.</m> Solving this equation for <m>x,</m> we see that we need <m>x</m> such that

    This equation is satisfied as long as there exists a real number <m>x</m> such that
   <me>x-4= \pm \sqrt{y-5}.</me>
    Since <m>y \geq 5,</m> the square root is well-defined. We conclude that for <m>x=4 \pm \sqrt{y-5},f(x)=y,</m> and therefore the range is <m>\{y|y \geq 5\}.</m></li>

    <li><p> To find the range of <m>f,</m> we note that since <m>\sqrt{3x+2}\geq 0,f(x)=\sqrt{3x+2}-1\geq -1.</m> Therefore, the range of <m>f</m> must be a subset of the set <m>\{y|y\geq-1\}.</m> To show that every element in this set is in the range of <m>f,</m> we need to show that for all <m>y</m> in this set, there exists a real number <m>x</m> in the domain such that <m>f(x)=y.</m> Let <m>y\geq-1.</m> Then, <m>f(x)=y</m> if and only if

    <title>Algebraic Formulas</title>
    <p id="fs-id1170572295705">Sometimes we are not given the values of a function in table form, rather we are given the values in an explicit formula. Formulas arise in many applications. For example, the area of a circle of radius <m>r</m> is given by the formula <m>A(r)=\pi r^2.</m> When an object is thrown upward from the ground with an initial velocity <m>v_0</m> ft/s, its height above the ground from the time it is thrown until it hits the ground is given by the formula <m>s(t)=-16t^2+v_0 t.</m> When <m>P</m> dollars are invested in an account at an annual interest rate <m>r</m> compounded continuously, the amount of money after <m>t</m> years is given by the formula <m>A(t)=Pe^{rt}.</m> Algebraic formulas are important tools to calculate function values. Often we also represent these functions visually in graph form.</p>
    <p id="fs-id1170572216050">Given an algebraic formula for a function <m>f,</m> the graph of <m>f</m> is the set of points <m>(x,f(x)),</m> where <m>x</m> is in the domain of <m>f</m> and <m>f(x)</m> is in the range. To graph a function given by a formula, it is helpful to begin by using the formula to create a table of inputs and outputs. If the domain of <m>f</m> consists of an infinite number of values, we cannot list all of them, but because listing some of the inputs and outputs can be very useful, it is often a good way to begin.</p>
    <p id="fs-id1170572454113">When creating a table of inputs and outputs, we typically check to determine whether zero is an output. Those values of <m>x</m> where <m>f(x)=0</m> are called the <term>zeros of a function</term>. For example, the zeros of <m>f(x)=x^2-4</m> are <m>x=±2.</m> The zeros determine where the graph of <m>f</m> intersects the <m>x</m>-axis, which gives us more information about the shape of the graph of the function. The graph of a function may never intersect the <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>-axis, or it may intersect multiple (or even infinitely many) times.</p>
    <p id="fs-id1170572449430">Another point of interest is the <m>y</m>-intercept, if it exists. The <m>y</m>-intercept is given by <m>(0,f(0)).</m></p>
    <p id="fs-id1170572177012">Since a function has exactly one output for each input, the graph of a function can have, at most, one <m>y</m>-intercept. If <m>x=0</m> is in the domain of a function <m>f,</m> then <m>f</m> has exactly one <m>y</m>-intercept. If <m>x=0</m> is not in the domain of <m>f,</m> then <m>f</m> has no <m>y</m>-intercept. Similarly, for any real number <m>c,</m> if <m>c</m> is in the domain of <m>f,</m> there is exactly one output <m>f(c),</m> and the line <m>x=c</m> intersects the graph of <m>f</m> exactly once. On the other hand, if <m>c</m> is not in the domain of <m>f,f(c)</m> is not defined and the line <m>x=c</m> does not intersect the graph of <m>f.</m> This property is summarized in the <term>vertical line test</term>.</p>

    <p id="fs-id1170572480870">Given a function <m>f,</m> every vertical line that may be drawn intersects the graph of <m>f</m> no more than once. If any vertical line intersects a set of points more than once, the set of points does not represent a function.</p>

      <introduction>
    <p id="fs-id1170572234066">Now that we have reviewed the basic characteristics of functions, we can see what happens to these properties when we combine functions in different ways, using basic mathematical operations to create new functions. For example, if the cost for a company to manufacture <m>x</m> items is described by the function <m>C(x)</m> and the revenue created by the sale of <m>x</m> items is described by the function <m>R(x),</m> then the profit on the manufacture and sale of <m>x</m> items is defined as <m>P(x)=R(x)-C(x).</m> Using the difference between two functions, we created a new function.</p>
    <p id="fs-id1170572135596">Alternatively, we can create a new function by composing two functions. For example, given the functions <m>f(x)=x^2</m> and <m>g(x)=3x+1,</m> the composite function <m>f\circ g</m> is defined such that</p>
    <me>(f\circ g)(x)=f(g(x))=(g(x))^2=(3x+1)^2.</me>
    <p id="fs-id1170572140952">The composite function <m>g\circ f</m> is defined such that</p>
    <me>(g\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))=3f(x)+1=3x^2+1.</me>

    <title>Symmetry of Functions</title>
    <p id="fs-id1170572213225">The graphs of certain functions have symmetry properties that help us understand the function and the shape of its graph. For example, consider the function <m>f(x)=x^4-2x^2-3</m> shown in <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_01_01_012"/>(a). If we take the part of the curve that lies to the right of the <m>y</m>-axis and flip it over the <m>y</m>-axis, it lays exactly on top of the curve to the left of the <m>y</m>-axis. In this case, we say the function has <term>symmetry about the <m>y</m>-axis</term>. On the other hand, consider the function <m>f(x)=x^3-4x</m> shown in <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_01_01_012"/>(b). If we take the graph and rotate it <m>180^{\circ}</m> about the origin, the new graph will look exactly the same. In this case, we say the function has <term>symmetry about the origin</term>.</p>

    <description> "An image of two graphs. The first graph is labeled “(a), symmetry about the y-axis” and is of the curved function “f(x) = (x to the 4th) - 2(x squared) - 3”. The x axis runs from -3 to 4 and the y axis runs from -4 to 5. This function decreases until it hits the point (-1, -4), which is minimum of the function. Then the graph increases to the point (0,3), which is a local maximum. Then the the graph decreases until it hits the point (1, -4), before it increases again. The second graph is labeled “(b), symmetry about the origin” and is of the curved function “f(x) = x cubed - 4x”. The x axis runs from -3 to 4 and the y axis runs from -4 to 5. The graph of the function starts at the x intercept at (-2, 0) and increases until the approximate point of (-1.2, 3.1). The function then decreases, passing through the origin, until it hits the approximate point of (1.2, -3.1). The function then begins to increase again and has another x intercept at (2, 0)." </description>

    <p id="fs-id1170572173116">If we are given the graph of a function, it is easy to see whether the graph has one of these symmetry properties. But without a graph, how can we determine algebraically whether a function <m>f</m> has symmetry? Looking at <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_01_01_012"/>(a) again, we see that since <m>f</m> is symmetric about the <m>y</m>-axis, if the point <m>(x,y)</m> is on the graph, the point <m>(-x,y)</m> is on the graph. In other words, <m>f(-x)=f(x).</m> If a function <m>f</m> has this property, we say <m>f</m> is an even function, which has symmetry about the <m>y</m>-axis. For example, <m>f(x)=x^2</m> is even because</p>
    <me>f(-x)=(-x)^2=x^2=f(x).</me>
    <p id="fs-id1170572552328">In contrast, looking at <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_01_01_012"/>(b) again, if a function <m>f</m> is symmetric about the origin, then whenever the point <m>(x,y)</m> is on the graph, the point <m>(-x,-y)</m> is also on the graph. In other words, <m>f(-x)=-f(x).</m> If <m>f</m> has this property, we say <m>f</m> is an odd function, which has symmetry about the origin. For example, <m>f(x)=x^3</m> is odd because</p>
