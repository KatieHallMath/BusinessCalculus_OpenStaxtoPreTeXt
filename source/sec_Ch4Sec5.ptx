  <title> Learning Objectives</title>
  <ul>

<li>Explain how the sign of the first derivative affects the shape of a function&#8217;s graph.</li>
<li>State the first derivative test for critical points.</li>
<li>Use concavity and inflection points to explain how the sign of the second derivative affects the shape of a function&#8217;s graph.</li>
<li>Explain the concavity test for a function over an open interval.</li>
<li>Explain the relationship between a function and its first and second derivatives.</li>
<li>State the second derivative test for local extrema.</li>
</ul>

<p id="fs-id1165043276297">Earlier in this chapter we stated that if a function <m>f</m> has a local extremum at a point <m>c,</m> then <m>c</m> must be a critical point of <m>f.</m> However, a function is not guaranteed to have a local extremum at a critical point. For example, <m>f(x)=x^3</m> has a critical point at <m>x=0</m> since <m>f(x)=3x^2</m> is zero at <m>x=0,</m> but <m>f</m> does not have a local extremum at <m>x=0.</m> Using the results from the previous section, we are now able to determine whether a critical point of a function actually corresponds to a local extreme value. In this section, we also see how the second derivative provides information about the shape of a graph by describing whether the graph of a function curves upward or curves downward.</p>

<title>The First Derivative Test</title>
<p id="fs-id1165043093996">Corollary <m>3</m> of the Mean Value Theorem showed that if the derivative of a function is positive over an interval <m>I</m> then the function is increasing over <m>I.</m> On the other hand, if the derivative of the function is negative over an interval <m>I,</m> then the function is decreasing over <m>I</m> as shown in the following figure.</p>

<description>"This figure is broken into four figures labeled a, b, c, and d. Figure a shows a function increasing convexly from (a, f(a)) to (b, f(b)). At two points the derivative is taken and it is noted that at both f' \gt  0. In other words, f is increasing. Figure b shows a function increasing concavely from (a, f(a)) to (b, f(b)). At two points the derivative is taken and it is noted that at both f' \gt  0. In other words, f is increasing. Figure c shows a function decreasing concavely from (a, f(a)) to (b, f(b)). At two points the derivative is taken and it is noted that at both f' \lt  0. In other words, f is decreasing. Figure d shows a function decreasing convexly from (a, f(a)) to (b, f(b)). At two points the derivative is taken and it is noted that at both f' \lt  0.

<p id="fs-id1165042319627">A continuous function <m>f</m> has a local maximum at point <m>c</m> if and only if <m>f</m> switches from increasing to decreasing at point <m>c.</m> Similarly, <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>c</m> if and only if <m>f</m> switches from decreasing to increasing at <m>c.</m> If <m>f</m> is a continuous function over an interval <m>I</m> containing <m>c</m> and differentiable over <m>I,</m> except possibly at <m>c,</m> the only way <m>f</m> can switch from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) at point <m>c</m> is if <m>f'</m> changes sign as <m>x</m> increases through <m>c.</m> If <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>c,</m> the only way that <m>f'.</m> can change sign as <m>x</m> increases through <m>c</m> is if <m>f'(c)=0.</m> Therefore, for a function <m>f</m> that is continuous over an interval <m>I</m> containing <m>c</m> and differentiable over <m>I,</m> except possibly at <m>c,</m> the only way <m>f</m> can switch from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) is if <m>f(c)=0</m> or <m>f'(c)</m> is undefined. Consequently, to locate local extrema for a function <m>f,</m> we look for points <m>c</m> in the domain of <m>f</m> such that <m>f(c)=0</m> or <m>f'(c)</m> is undefined. Recall that such points are called critical points of <m>f.</m></p>
<p id="fs-id1165043051419">Note that <m>f</m> need not have a local extrema at a critical point. The critical points are candidates for local extrema only. In <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_04_05_002"/>, we show that if a continuous function <m>f</m> has a local extremum, it must occur at a critical point, but a function may not have a local extremum at a critical point. We show that if <m>f</m> has a local extremum at a critical point, then the sign of <m>f'</m> switches as <m>x</m> increases through that point.</p>

<description>"A function f(x) is graphed. It starts in the second quadrant and increases to x = a, which is too sharp and hence f'(a) is undefined. In this section f' \gt  0. Then, f decreases from x = a to x = b (so f' \lt  0 here), before increasing at x = b. It is noted that f'(b) = 0. While increasing from x = b to x = c, f' \gt  0. The function has an inversion point at c, and it is marked f'(c) = 0. The function increases some more to d (so f' \gt  0), which is the global maximum. It is marked that f'(d) = 0. Then the function decreases and it is marked that f' \gt  0." </description></image> <caption>The function <m>f</m> has four critical points: <m>a,b,c, \text{ and } d.</m> The function <m>f</m> has local maxima at <m>a</m> and <m>d,</m> and a local minimum at <m>b.</m> The function <m>f</m> does not have a local extremum at <m>c.</m> The sign of <m>f</m> changes at all local extrema.</caption>
