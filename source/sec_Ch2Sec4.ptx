<p id="fs-id1170570996716">Many functions have the property that their graphs can be traced with a pencil without lifting the pencil from the page. Such functions are called <emphasis effect="italics">continuous</emphasis>. Other functions have points at which a break in the graph occurs, but satisfy this property over intervals contained in their domains. They are continuous on these intervals and are said to have a <emphasis effect="italics">discontinuity at a point</emphasis> where a break occurs.</p>
<p id="fs-id1170573595201">We begin our investigation of continuity by exploring what it means for a function to have <emphasis effect="italics">continuity at a point</emphasis>. Intuitively, a function is continuous at a particular point if there is no break in its graph at that point.</p>

<title>Continuity at a Point</title>
<p id="fs-id1170573324888">Before we look at a formal definition of what it means for a function to be continuous at a point, let’s consider various functions that fail to meet our intuitive notion of what it means to be continuous at a point. We then create a list of conditions that prevent such failures.</p>
<p id="fs-id1170573390124">Our first function of interest is shown in <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_02_04_001"/>. We see that the graph of <m>f(x)</m> has a hole at <m>a</m>. In fact, <m>f(a)</m> is undefined. At the very least, for <m>f(x)</m> to be continuous at <m>a</m>, we need the following condition:</p>
<me>\text{ i. } f(a) \text{ is defined. }</me>

<description>"A graph of an increasing linear function f(x) which crosses the x axis from quadrant three to quadrant two and which crosses the y axis from quadrant two to quadrant one.

</figure>
<p id="fs-id1170573750564">However, as we see in <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_02_04_002"/>, this condition alone is insufficient to guarantee continuity at the point <m>a</m>. Although <m>f(a)</m> is defined, the function has a gap at <m>a</m>. In this example, the gap exists because <m>\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to a}f(x)}</m> does not exist.

<title>Types of Discontinuities</title>
<p id="fs-id1170573435662">As we have seen in <xref ref="fs-id1170573442080"/> and <xref ref="fs-id1170573389760"/>, discontinuities take on several different appearances. We classify the types of discontinuities we have seen thus far as removable discontinuities, infinite discontinuities, or jump discontinuities. Intuitively, a <term>removable discontinuity</term> is a discontinuity for which there is a hole in the graph, a <term>jump discontinuity</term> is a noninfinite discontinuity for which the sections of the function do not meet up, and an <term>infinite discontinuity</term> is a discontinuity located at a vertical asymptote. <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_02_04_006"/> illustrates the differences in these types of discontinuities. Although these terms provide a handy way of describing three common types of discontinuities, keep in mind that not all discontinuities fit neatly into these categories.</p>

<description>"Three graphs, each showing a different discontinuity. The first is removable discontinuity. Here, the given function is a line with positive slope. At a point x=a, where a\gt 0, there is an open circle on the line and a closed circle a few units above the line. The second is a jump discontinuity. Here, there are two lines with positive slope. The first line exists for x\lt =a, and the second exists for x\gt a, where a\gt 0. The first line ends at a solid circle where x=a, and the second begins a few units up with an open circle at x=a. The third discontinuity type is infinite discontinuity. Here, the function has two parts separated by an asymptote x=a. The first segment is a curve stretching along the x axis to 0 as x goes to negative infinity and along the y axis to infinity as x goes to zero. The second segment is a curve stretching along the y axis to negative infinity as x goes to zero and along the x axis to 0 as x goes to infinity."  </description></image> <caption>Discontinuities are classified as (a) removable, (b) jump, or (c) infinite.</caption>

<title>Continuity over an Interval</title>
<p id="fs-id1170573612125">Now that we have explored the concept of continuity at a point, we extend that idea to <term>continuity over an interval</term>. As we develop this idea for different types of intervals, it may be useful to keep in mind the intuitive idea that a function is continuous over an interval if we can use a pencil to trace the function between any two points in the interval without lifting the pencil from the paper. In preparation for defining continuity on an interval, we begin by looking at the definition of what it means for a function to be continuous from the right at a point and continuous from the left at a point.</p>
<note id="fs-id1170573581958">
<title>Continuity from the Right and from the Left</title>
<p id="fs-id1170573352232">A function <m>f(x)</m> is said to be <term>continuous from the right</term> at <m>a</m> if <m>\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=f(a).}</m></p>
<p id="fs-id1170571120467">A function <m>f(x)</m> is said to be <term>continuous from the left</term> at <m>a</m> if <m>\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=f(a).}</m></p>
</note>
<p id="fs-id1170570967081">A function is continuous over an open interval if it is continuous at every point in the interval. A function <m>f(x)</m> is continuous over a closed interval of the form <m>[a,b]</m> if it is continuous at every point in <m>(a,b)</m> and is continuous from the right at <m>a</m> and is continuous from the left at <m>b</m>. Analogously, a function <m>f(x)</m> is continuous over an interval of the form <m>(a,b]</m> if it is continuous over <m>(a,b)</m> and is continuous from the left at <m>b</m>. Continuity over other types of intervals are defined in a similar fashion.</p>

If, for example, <m>\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)\neq f(a),}</m> we would need to lift our pencil to jump from <m>f(a)</m> to the graph of the rest of the function over <m>(a,b].</m></p>
