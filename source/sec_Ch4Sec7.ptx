<p id="fs-id1165042965394">One common application of calculus is calculating the minimum or maximum value of a function. For example, companies often want to minimize production costs or maximize revenue. In manufacturing, it is often desirable to minimize the amount of material used to package a product with a certain volume. In this section, we show how to set up these types of minimization and maximization problems and solve them by using the tools developed in this chapter.</p>
</introduction>
<subsection id="fs-id1165042514973">
<title>Solving Optimization Problems over a Closed, Bounded Interval</title>
<p id="fs-id1165043329454">The basic idea of the <term>optimization problems</term> that follow is the same. We have a particular quantity that we are interested in maximizing or minimizing. However, we also have some auxiliary condition that needs to be satisfied. For example, in <xref ref="fs-id1165043431956"/>, we are interested in maximizing the area of a rectangular garden. Certainly, if we keep making the side lengths of the garden larger, the area will continue to become larger. However, what if we have some restriction on how much fencing we can use for the perimeter? In this case, we cannot make the garden as large as we like. Let's look at how we can maximize the area of a rectangle subject to some constraint on the perimeter.</p>
<example xml:id="fs-id1165043431956">
<title>Maximizing the Area of a Garden</title>
<statement id="fs-id1165043352930">
<p id="fs-id1165042623548">A rectangular garden is to be constructed using a rock wall as one side of the garden and wire fencing for the other three sides (<xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_04_07_001"/>). Given <m>100</m> ft of wire fencing, determine the dimensions that would create a garden of maximum area. What is the maximum area?</p>

There is a rock wall running along the entire bottom horizontal length of the drawing." </description></image> <caption>We want to determine the measurements <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> that will create a garden with a maximum area using <m>100</m> ft of fencing.</caption>

</statement>
<solution id="fs-id1165043116050">
<p id="fs-id1165043262577">Let <m>x</m> denote the length of the side of the garden perpendicular to the rock wall and <m>y</m> denote the length of the side parallel to the rock wall. Then the area of the garden is</p>
<me>A=x\cdot y.</me>
<p id="fs-id1165043222797">We want to find the maximum possible area subject to the constraint that the total fencing is <m>100 \text{ ft }.</m> From <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_04_07_001"/>, the total amount of fencing used will be <m>2x+y.</m> Therefore, the constraint equation is</p>
<me>2x+y=100.</me>
<p id="fs-id1165043272012">Solving this equation for <m>y,</m> we have <m>y=100-2x.</m> Thus, we can write the area as</p>
<me>A(x)=x\cdot(100-2x)=100x-2x^2.</me>
<p id="fs-id1165043195368">Before trying to maximize the area function <m>A(x)=100x-2x^2,</m> we need to determine the domain under consideration. To construct a rectangular garden, we certainly need the lengths of both sides to be positive. Therefore, we need <m>x\gt 0</m> and <m>y\gt 0.</m> Since <m>y=100-2x,</m> if <m>y\gt 0,</m> then <m>x\lt 50.</m> Therefore, we are trying to determine the maximum value of <m>A(x)</m> for <m>x</m> over the open interval <m>(0,50).</m> We do not know that a function necessarily has a maximum value over an open interval. However, we do know that a continuous function has an absolute maximum (and absolute minimum) over a closed interval. Therefore, let's consider the function <m>A(x)=100x-2x^2</m> over the closed interval <m>[0,50].</m> If the maximum value occurs at an interior point, then we have found the value <m>x</m> in the open interval <m>(0,50)</m> that maximizes the area of the garden. Therefore, we consider the following problem:</p>
<p id="fs-id1165043094646">Maximize <m>A(x)=100x-2x^2</m> over the interval <m>[0,50].</m></p>
<p id="fs-id1165042989293">As mentioned earlier, since <m>A</m> is a continuous function on a closed, bounded interval, by the extreme value theorem, it has a maximum and a minimum. These extreme values occur either at endpoints or critical points. At the endpoints, <m>A(x)=0.</m> Since the area is positive for all <m>x</m> in the open interval <m>(0,50),</m> the maximum must occur at a critical point. Differentiating the function <m>A(x),</m> we obtain</p>
<me>A'(x)=100-4x.</me>
<p id="fs-id1165043178466">Therefore, the only critical point is <m>x=25</m> (<xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_04_07_002"/>). We conclude that the maximum area must occur when <m>x=25.</m> Then we have <m>y=100-2x=100-2(25)=50.</m> To maximize the area of the garden, let <m>x=25</m> ft and <m>y=50 \text{ ft }.</m> The area of this garden is <m>1250\text{ft}^2</m></p>

<p id="fs-id1165043029463">Now let's apply this strategy to maximize the volume of an open-top box given a constraint on the amount of material to be used.</p>

<title>Maximizing the Volume of a Box</title>

<p id="fs-id1165042638735">An open-top box is to be made from a <m>24</m> in. by <m>36</m> in. piece of cardboard by removing a square from each corner of the box and folding up the flaps on each side. What size square should be cut out of each corner to get a box with the maximum volume?</p>

<p id="fs-id1165043092635">Step 1: Let <m>x</m> be the side length of the square to be removed from each corner (<xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_04_07_003"/>). Then, the remaining four flaps can be folded up to form an open-top box. Let <m>V</m> be the volume of the resulting box.</p>

<p id="fs-id1165042330556">Step 2: We are trying to maximize the volume of a box. Therefore, the problem is to maximize <m>V.</m></p>
<p id="fs-id1165043251052">Step 3: As mentioned in step <m>2,</m> are trying to maximize the volume of a box. The volume of a box is <m>V=L\cdot W\cdot H,</m> where <m>L,W, \text{ and } H</m> are the length, width, and height, respectively.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165042609059">Step 4: From <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_04_07_003"/>, we see that the height of the box is <m>x</m> inches, the length is <m>36-2x</m> inches, and the width is <m>24-2x</m> inches. Therefore, the volume of the box is</p>
<me>V(x)=(36-2x)(24-2x)x=4x^3-120x^2+864x.</me>
<p id="fs-id1165043115396">Step 5: To determine the domain of consideration, let's examine <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_04_07_003"/>. Certainly, we need <m>x\gt 0.</m> Furthermore, the side length of the square cannot be greater than or equal to half the length of the shorter side, <m>24</m> in.; otherwise, one of the flaps would be completely cut off. Therefore, we are trying to determine whether there is a maximum volume of the box for <m>x</m> over the open interval <m>(0,12).</m> Since <m>V</m> is a continuous function over the closed interval <m>[0,12],</m> we know <m>V</m> will have an absolute maximum over the closed interval. Therefore, we consider <m>V</m> over the closed interval <m>[0,12]</m> and check whether the absolute maximum occurs at an interior point.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165043017956">Step 6: Since <m>V(x)</m> is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval <m>[0,12],</m> <m>V</m> must have an absolute maximum (and an absolute minimum). Since <m>V(x)=0</m> at the endpoints and <m>V(x)\gt 0</m> for <m>0\lt x\lt 12,</m> the maximum must occur at a critical point. The derivative is</p>
<me>V'(x)=12x^2-240x+864.</me>
<p id="fs-id1165042608183">To find the critical points, we need to solve the equation</p>
<me>12x^2-240x+864=0.</me>
<p id="fs-id1165043209010">Dividing both sides of this equation by <m>12,</m> the problem simplifies to solving the equation</p>
<me>x^2-20x+72=0.</me>
<p id="fs-id1165043060298">Using the quadratic formula, we find that the critical points are</p>

<example>
<statement>A theater owner charges $5 per ticket and sells 250 tickets. By checking other theaters, the owner decided that for every one dollar she raises the ticket price, she will lose 10 customers. What should she charge to maximize revenue?</statement>
<solution><p>Step 1: We can model the problem by defining the following variables:</p>
<md>
<mrow>n\amp=\text{ number of 1 dollar increases}</mrow>
<mrow>x\amp=\text{ number of tickets sold (quantity)}</mrow>
<mrow>p\amp=\text{ price per ticket}</mrow>
</md>
<p>Step 2: We are trying to maximize the revenue. Therefore, the problem is to maximize <m>R</m>.</p>
<p>Step 3: As mentioned in step 2 are trying to maximize the revenue. Recall that the revenue is given by <m>R=p\cdot x</m>. Currently, the theater owner charges $5 per ticket and sells 250 tickets but for every one dollar she raises the ticket price, she will lose 10 customers. Since <m>n</m> is the number of $1 increases, this gives us our constraints</p>
<md>
<mrow>x\amp=250-10n</mrow>
<mrow>p\amp=5+n</mrow>.
</md>
<p>Step 4: Using the equations from step 3, we see that the revenue equation is given by</p>
<me>R=p\cdot x=(5+n)(250-10n)</me>.
<p>Step 5: In order to determine the domain of consideration, note that we need <m>x\geq 0\text{ and }p\geq0</m>. Using the equations from step 3:</p>
<p><m>x\geq0:</m></p>
<md>
<mrow>250-10n\amp\geq0</mrow>
<mrow>n\amp\geq25</mrow>

<p><m>p\geq0:</m></p>

<mrow>5+n\amp\geq0</mrow>
<mrow>n\amp\geq-5.</mrow>
</md>
<p>Therefore, we are trying to determine whether there is a maximum revenue over the closed interval [-5,25]. Since <m>R</m> is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval [-5,25] it has an absolute maximum (and an absolute minimum) in that interval. To find the maximum value, look for critical points. The derivative is <m>R'(n)=1\cdot(250-10n)+(5+n)\cdot(-10)=200-20n</m>. Therefore, the critical point is <m>n=10</m>. When <m>n=10,\; R(10)=\$2250</m>. When <m>n=-5,\; R(-5)=\$0</m>. When <m>n=25,\; R(25)=\$0</m>. Therefore, the absolute maximum occurs at <m>n=10</m>. Note that when <m>n=10,\;p=5+10=\$15.</m>The theater owner should charge $15 per ticket in order to maximize revenue as shown in the following figure.</p>
