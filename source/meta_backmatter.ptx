    <p> The conversion from the OpenStax Calculus CNXML to  <pretext/> format was done by Katie Hall at University of Connecticut in summer 2022. If you'd like to help improve this conversion or convert other volumes, please contact me at <email> katie.hall@uconn.edu </email> </p>

    <p> Using the <pretext/> format, this book was also edited by Kim Savinon and Katie Hall to be used for a business calculus course. </p>
