<p id="fs-id1167793932795">In <xref ref="ch_fifth">Introduction to Integration</xref>, we developed the concept of the definite integral to calculate the area below a curve on a given interval. In this section, we expand that idea to calculate the area of more complex regions. We start by finding the area between two curves that are functions of <m>x,</m> beginning with the simple case in which one function value is always greater than the other. We then look at cases when the graphs of the functions cross. Last, we consider how to calculate the area between two curves that are functions of <m>y.</m></p>

<p id="fs-id1167793579591">In <xref ref="fs-id1167793455088"/>, we had to evaluate two separate integrals to calculate the area of the region. However, there is another approach that requires only one integral. What if we treat the curves as functions of <m>y,</m> instead of as functions of <m>x?</m> Review <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_06_01_006"/>. Note that the left graph, shown in red, is represented by the function <m>y=f(x)=x^2.</m> We could just as easily solve this for <m>x</m> and represent the curve by the function <m>x=v(y)=\sqrt{y}.</m> (Note that <m>x=- \sqrt{y}</m> is also a valid representation of the function <m>y=f(x)=x^2</m> as a function of <m>y.</m> However, based on the graph, it is clear we are interested in the positive square root.) Similarly, the right graph is represented by the function <m>y=g(x)=2-x,</m> but could just as easily be represented by the function <m>x=u(y)=2-y.</m> When the graphs are represented as functions of <m>y,</m> we see the region is bounded on the left by the graph of one function and on the right by the graph of the other function.

<title>Key Concepts</title>
<ul>
<li>Just as definite integrals can be used to find the area under a curve, they can also be used to find the area between two curves.</li>
<li>To find the area between two curves defined by functions, integrate the difference of the functions.</li>
<li>If the graphs of the functions cross, or if the region is complex, use the absolute value of the difference of the functions. In this case, it may be necessary to evaluate two or more integrals and add the results to find the area of the region.</li>
<!--Commenting out integration with respect to y
