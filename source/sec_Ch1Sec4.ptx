<p id="fs-id1170572215818">An inverse function reverses the operation done by a particular function. In other words, whatever a function does, the inverse function undoes it. In this section, we define an inverse function formally and state the necessary conditions for an inverse function to exist. We examine how to find an inverse function and study the relationship between the graph of a function and the graph of its inverse. Then we apply these ideas to define and discuss properties of the inverse trigonometric functions.</p>

<title>Existence of an Inverse Function</title>
<p id="fs-id1170572151010">We begin with an example. Given a function <m>f</m> and an output <m>y=f(x),</m> we are often interested in finding what value or values <m>x</m> were mapped to <m>y</m> by <m>f.</m> For example, consider the function <m>f(x)=x^3+4.</m> Since any output <m>y=x^3+4,</m> we can solve this equation for <m>x</m> to find that the input is <m>x=\sqrt[3]{y-3}.</m> This equation defines <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y.</m> Denoting this function as <m>f^{−1}</m>, and writing <m>x=f^{−1} (y)=\sqrt[3]{y-3},</m> we see that for any <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f,f^{−1} (f(x))=f^{−1} (x^3+4)=x.</m> Thus, this new function, <m>f^{−1} ,</m> “undid” what the original function <m>f</m> did. A function with this property is called the inverse function of the original function.</p>

<p id="fs-id1170572141586">Recall that a function has exactly one output for each input. Therefore, to define an inverse function, we need to map each input to exactly one output. For example, let’s try to find the inverse function for <m>f(x)=x^2.</m> Solving the equation <m>y=x^2</m> for <m>x,</m> we arrive at the equation <m>x=\pm \sqrt{y}.</m> This equation does not describe <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m> because there are two solutions to this equation for every <m>y\gt 0.</m> The problem with trying to find an inverse function for <m>f(x)=x^2</m> is that two inputs are sent to the same output for each output <m>y\gt 0.</m> The function <m>f(x)=x^3+4</m> discussed earlier did not have this problem. For that function, each input was sent to a different output. A function that sends each input to a <emphasis effect="italics">different</emphasis> output is called a one-to-one function.</p>
<definition> <!-- Change next /note to /definition-->
<p id="fs-id1170572229709">We say a <m>f</m> is a <term>one-to-one function</term> if <m>f(x_1)\neq f(x_2)</m> when <m>x_1\neq x_2.</m></p>
</definition>
<p id="fs-id1170572103424">One way to determine whether a function is one-to-one is by looking at its graph. If a function is one-to-one, then no two inputs can be sent to the same output. Therefore, if we draw a horizontal line anywhere in the <m>xy</m>-plane, according to the <term>horizontal line test</term>, it cannot intersect the graph more than once. We note that the horizontal line test is different from the vertical line test. The vertical line test determines whether a graph is the graph of a function. The horizontal line test determines whether a function is one-to-one (<xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_01_04_002"/>).</p>

<title>Finding a Function’s Inverse</title>
  <introduction>
<p id="fs-id1170572150503">We can now consider one-to-one functions and show how to find their inverses. Recall that a function maps elements in the domain of <m>f</m> to elements in the range of <m>f.</m> The inverse function maps each element from the range of <m>f</m> back to its corresponding element from the domain of <m>f.</m> Therefore, to find the inverse function of a one-to-one function <m>f,</m> given any <m>y</m> in the range of <m>f,</m> we need to determine which <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m> satisfies <m>f(x)=y.</m> Since <m>f</m> is one-to-one, there is exactly one such value <m>x.</m> We can find that value <m>x</m> by solving the equation <m>f(x)=y</m> for <m>x.</m> Doing so, we are able to write <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m> where the domain of this function is the range of <m>f</m> and the range of this new function is the domain of <m>f.</m> Consequently, this function is the inverse of <m>f,</m> and we write <m>x=f^{−1} (y).</m> Since we typically use the variable <m>x</m> to denote the independent variable and <m>y</m> to denote the dependent variable, we often interchange the roles of <m>x</m> and <m>y,</m> and write <m>y=f^{−1} (x).</m> Representing the inverse function in this way is also helpful later when we graph a function <m>f</m> and its inverse <m>f^{−1} </m> on the same axes.</p>

<p id="fs-id1170572366201">When evaluating an inverse trigonometric function, the output is an angle.

However, given the definition of <m>\cos^{-1},</m> we need the angle <m>\theta </m> that not only solves this equation, but also lies in the interval <m>[0,\pi].</m> We conclude that <m>\cos^{-1}(\frac{1}{2})=\frac{\pi}{3}.</m></p>
<p id="fs-id1170572472189">We now consider a composition of a trigonometric function and its inverse. For example, consider the two expressions <m>\sin(\sin^{-1} (\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}))</m> and <m>\sin^{-1} (\sin(\pi)).</m> For the first one, we simplify as follows:</p>
<me>\sin(\sin^{-1} ( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}))=\sin( \frac{\pi}{4})= \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.</me>
<p id="fs-id1170572548620">For the second one, we have</p>
<me>\sin^{-1} (\sin(\pi))=\sin^{-1} (0)=0.</me>
<p id="fs-id1170572548676">The inverse function is supposed to “undo” the original function, so why isn’t <m>\sin^{-1} (\sin(\pi))=\pi?</m> Recalling our definition of inverse functions, a function <m>f</m> and its inverse <m>f^{−1} </m> satisfy the conditions <m>f(f^{−1} (y))=y</m> for all <m>y</m> in the domain of <m>f^{−1} </m> and <m>f^{−1} (f(x))=x</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f,</m> so what happened here?

<title>Key Concepts</title>
<ul>
<li>For a function to have an inverse, the function must be one-to-one. Given the graph of a function, we can determine whether the function is one-to-one by using the horizontal line test.</li>
<li>If a function is not one-to-one, we can restrict the domain to a smaller domain where the function is one-to-one and then define the inverse of the function on the smaller domain.</li>
<li>For a function <m>f</m> and its inverse <m>f^{−1} ,f(f^{−1} (x))=x</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f^{−1} </m> and <m>f^{−1} (f(x))=x</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f.</m></li>
<li>Since the trigonometric functions are periodic, we need to restrict their domains to define the inverse trigonometric functions.</li>
<li>The graph of a function <m>f</m> and its inverse <m>f^{−1} </m> are symmetric about the line <m>y=x.</m></li>
