<p id="fs-id1165042066715">Given a particular function, we are often interested in determining the largest and smallest values of the function. This information is important in creating accurate graphs. Finding the maximum and minimum values of a function also has practical significance because we can use this method to solve optimization problems, such as maximizing profit, minimizing the amount of material used in manufacturing an aluminum can, or finding the maximum height a rocket can reach. In this section, we look at how to use derivatives to find the largest and smallest values for a function.</p>

<title>Absolute Extrema</title>
<p id="fs-id1165040644979">Consider the function <m>f(x)=x^2+1</m> over the interval <m>(-\infty ,\infty ).</m> As <m>x\to \pm \infty ,</m> <m>f(x)\to \infty .</m> Therefore, the function does not have a largest value. However, since <m>x^2+1\geq 1</m> for all real numbers <m>x</m> and <m>x^2+1=1</m> when <m>x=0,</m> the function has a smallest value, 1, when <m>x=0.</m> We say that 1 is the absolute minimum of <m>f(x)=x^2+1</m> and it occurs at <m>x=0.</m> We say that <m>f(x)=x^2+1</m> does not have an absolute maximum (see the following figure).</p>

<p id="fs-id1165041930563">Let <m>f</m> be a function defined over an interval <m>I</m> and let <m>c∈I.</m> We say <m>f</m> has an <term>absolute maximum</term> on <m>I</m> at <m>c</m> if <m>f(c)\geq f(x)</m> for all <m>x∈I.</m> We say <m>f</m> has an <term>absolute minimum</term> on <m>I</m> at <m>c</m> if <m>f(c)\leq f(x)</m> for all <m>x∈I.</m> If <m>f</m> has an absolute maximum on <m>I</m> at <m>c</m> or an absolute minimum on <m>I</m> at <m>c,</m> we say <m>f</m> has an <term>absolute extremum</term> on <m>I</m> at <m>c.</m></p>
</definition>
<p id="fs-id1165041811976">Before proceeding, let’s note two important issues regarding this definition. First, the term <em>absolute</em> here does not refer to absolute value. An absolute extremum may be positive, negative, or zero. Second, if a function <m>f</m> has an absolute extremum over an interval <m>I</m> at <m>c,</m> the absolute extremum is <m>f(c).</m> The real number <m>c</m> is a point in the domain at which the absolute extremum occurs. For example, consider the function <m>f(x)=1/(x^2+1)</m> over the interval <m>(-\infty ,\infty ).</m> Since</p>
<me>f(0)=1\geq \frac{1}{x^2+1}=f(x)</me>
<p id="fs-id1165041952862">for all real numbers <m>x,</m> we say <m>f</m> has an absolute maximum over <m>(-\infty ,\infty )</m> at <m>x=0.</m> The absolute maximum is <m>f(0)=1.</m> It occurs at <m>x=0,</m> as shown in <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_04_03_002"/>(b).</p>
<p id="fs-id1165041795038">A function may have both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum, just one extremum, or neither. <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_04_03_002"/> shows several functions and some of the different possibilities regarding absolute extrema.

<title>Extreme Value Theorem</title>
<p id="fs-id1165042274290">If <m>f</m> is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval <m>[a,b],</m> then there is a point in <m>[a,b]</m> at which <m>f</m> has an absolute maximum over <m>[a,b]</m> and there is a point in <m>[a,b]</m> at which <m>f</m> has an absolute minimum over <m>[a,b].</m></p>
</theorem>
<p id="fs-id1165040759275">The proof of the extreme value theorem is beyond the scope of this text. Typically, it is proved in a course on real analysis. There are a couple of key points to note about the statement of this theorem. For the extreme value theorem to apply, the function must be continuous over a closed, bounded interval. If the interval <m>I</m> is open or the function has even one point of discontinuity, the function may not have an absolute maximum or absolute minimum over <m>I.</m> For example, consider the functions shown in <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_04_03_002"/>(d), (e), and (f). All three of these functions are defined over bounded intervals. However, the function in graph (e) is the only one that has both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum over its domain. The extreme value theorem cannot be applied to the functions in graphs (d) and (f) because neither of these functions is continuous over a closed, bounded interval. Although the function in graph (d) is defined over the closed interval <m>[0,4],</m> the function is discontinuous at <m>x=2.</m> The function has an absolute maximum over <m>[0,4]</m> but does not have an absolute minimum. The function in graph (f) is continuous over the half-open interval <m>[0,2),</m> but is not defined at <m>x=2,</m> and therefore is not continuous over a closed, bounded interval. The function has an absolute minimum over <m>[0,2),</m> but does not have an absolute maximum over <m>[0,2).</m> These two graphs illustrate why a function over a bounded interval may fail to have an absolute maximum and/or absolute minimum.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165041805532">Before looking at how to find absolute extrema, let’s examine the related concept of local extrema. This idea is useful in determining where absolute extrema occur.</p>

<title>Local Extrema and Critical Points</title>
<p id="fs-id1165042120195">Consider the function <m>f</m> shown in <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_04_03_003"/>. The graph can be described as two mountains with a valley in the middle. The absolute maximum value of the function occurs at the higher peak, at <m>x=2.</m> However, <m>x=0</m> is also a point of interest. Although <m>f(0)</m> is not the largest value of <m>f,</m> the value <m>f(0)</m> is larger than <m>f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> near 0. We say <m>f</m> has a local maximum at <m>x=0.</m> Similarly, the function <m>f</m> does not have an absolute minimum, but it does have a local minimum at <m>x=1</m> because <m>f(1)</m> is less than <m>f(x)</m> for <m>x</m> near 1.</p>

<p id="fs-id1165041836623">A function <m>f</m> has a <term>local maximum</term> at <m>c</m> if there exists an open interval <m>I</m> containing <m>c</m> such that <m>I</m> is contained in the domain of <m>f</m> and <m>f(c)\geq f(x)</m> for all <m>x∈I.</m> A function <m>f</m> has a <term>local minimum</term> at <m>c</m> if there exists an open interval <m>I</m> containing <m>c</m> such that <m>I</m> is contained in the domain of <m>f</m> and <m>f(c)\leq f(x)</m> for all <m>x∈I.</m> A function <m>f</m> has a <term>local extremum</term> at <m>c</m> if <m>f</m> has a local maximum at <m>c</m> or <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>c.</m></p>

<p id="fs-id1165042007321">Note that if <m>f</m> has an absolute extremum at <m>c</m> and <m>f</m> is defined over an interval containing <m>c,</m> then <m>f(c)</m> is also considered a local extremum. If an absolute extremum for a function <m>f</m> occurs at an endpoint, we do not consider that to be a local extremum, but instead refer to that as an endpoint extremum.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165041841707">Given the graph of a function <m>f,</m> it is sometimes easy to see where a local maximum or local minimum occurs. However, it is not always easy to see, since the interesting features on the graph of a function may not be visible because they occur at a very small scale. Also, we may not have a graph of the function. In these cases, how can we use a formula for a function to determine where these extrema occur?</p>
<p id="fs-id1165042305291">To answer this question, let’s look at <xref ref="CNX_Calc_Figure_04_03_003"/> again. The local extrema occur at <m>x=0,</m> <m>x=1,</m> and <m>x=2.</m> Notice that at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=1,</m> the derivative <m>f'(x)=0.</m> At <m>x=2,</m> the derivative <m>f'(x)</m> does not exist, since the function <m>f</m> has a corner there. In fact, if <m>f</m> has a local extremum at a point <m>x=c,</m> the derivative <m>f'(c)</m> must satisfy one of the following conditions: either <m>f'(c)=0</m> or <m>f'(c)</m> is undefined. Such a value <m>c</m> is known as a critical point and it is important in finding extreme values for functions.</p>

<p id="fs-id1165041779119">Let <m>c</m> be an interior point in the domain of <m>f.</m> We say that <m>c</m> is a <term>critical point</term> of <m>f</m> if <m>f'(c)=0</m> or <m>f'(c)</m> is undefined.</p>
</definition>
<p id="fs-id1165042038752">As mentioned earlier, if <m>f</m> has a local extremum at a point <m>x=c,</m> then <m>c</m> must be a critical point of <m>f.</m> This fact is known as <term>Fermat’s theorem</term>.</p>

<p id="fs-id1165041832115">Note this theorem does not claim that a function <m>f</m> must have a local extremum at a critical point.

<p id="fs-id1165042035403">Consider a continuous function <m>f</m> defined over an interval that is not closed i.e.<m>(a,b],\;[a,b),\text{ or }(a,b).</m></p>

<li>We would like to evaluate <m>f</m> at the endpoints <m>x=a</m> and <m>x=b</m> but they may not be included in the interval. As a result, we may need to take a one sided limit. The proceedure is outlined below:
  <ul>
  <li>If the left endpoint <m>a</m> is not included in the interval (i.e. the given interval is (a,b]), then evaluate <m>\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)}</m> and <m>f(b).</m></li>
  <li>If the right endpoint <m>b</m> is not included in the interval (i.e. the given interval is [a,b)), then evaluate <m>\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to b^-}f(x)}</m> and <m>f(a).</m></li>
  <li>If both the left and right endpoints <m>a \text{ and } b</m> are not included in the interval (i.e. the given interval is (a,b)), then evaluate <m>\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)}</m> and <m>\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to b^-}f(x)}.</m></li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Find all critical points of <m>f</m> that lie over the interval <m>(a,b)</m> and evaluate <m>f</m> at those critical points.</li>
<li>Compare all values found in (1) and (2). We know that the absolute extrema must occur at endpoints or critical points. However, if absolute extrema occurs at an endpoint not included in the interval, we say the absolute maximum or absolute minimum DNE. Therefore, the largest of these values is the absolute maximum of <m>f</m> if it occurred at a point included in the interval. The smallest of these values is the absolute minimum of <m>f</m> if it occurred at a point included in the interval. Otherwise, the absolute maximum or absolute minimum DNE.</li>

<me>f(-7)\approx 1.9982 \text{ and } f(1)\approx 18.3097</me>
Step 2.

<p>In this section, we determined the value and existence of absolute extrema over any given interval. We also defined local extrema and determined that if a function <m>f</m> has a local extremum at a point <m>c,</m> then <m>c</m> must be a critical point of <m>f.</m> However, <m>c</m> being a critical point is not a sufficient condition for <m>f</m> to have a local extremum at <m>c.</m> Later in this chapter, we show how to determine whether a function actually has a local extremum at a critical point. <!-- Commenting out Mean Value Theorem
First, however, we need to introduce the Mean Value Theorem, which will help as we analyze the behavior of the graph of a function.
