<p>In the case of higher-degree polynomials, it may be more complicated to determine where the graph intersects the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis. In some instances, it is possible to find the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-intercepts by factoring the polynomial to find its zeros. In other cases, it is impossible to calculate the exact values of the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-intercepts. However, as we see later in the text, in cases such as this, we can use analytical tools to approximate (to a very high degree) where the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-intercepts are located. Here we focus on the graphs of polynomials for which we can calculate their zeros explicitly.</p>
