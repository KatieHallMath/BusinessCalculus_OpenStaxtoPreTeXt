<p>We've seen that when demand is elastic, (<span class="process-math">\(E&gt;1\)</span>), when we make a change to the price, the change to demand (as a percent) is larger then the percent change to price. For example, when <span class="process-math">\(E=2 \text{,}\)</span> a 10% increase in price leads to a 20% decrease in demand. If we consider the revenue, since price only goes up 10% but demand goes down 20%, we will get less revenue overall. Therefore, if <span class="process-math">\(E&gt;1\text{,}\)</span> increasing price decreases revenue. On the other hand, when demand is inelastic, (<span class="process-math">\(E \lt 1\)</span>), when we make a change to the price, the change to demand (as a percent) is smaller then the percent change to price. For example, when <span class="process-math">\(E=1/2 \text{,}\)</span> a 20% increase in price leads to a 10% decrease in demand. If we consider the revenue, since price goes up 20% but demand only goes down 10%, we will get more revenue overall. Therefore, if <span class="process-math">\(E\lt 1\text{,}\)</span> increasing price increases revenue. Right in the middle of these cases, when <span class="process-math">\(E=1 \text{,}\)</span> we are at an equilibrium point and revenue is maximized. This is summarized below.</p>
