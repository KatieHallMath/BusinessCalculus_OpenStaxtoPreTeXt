The first graph is labeled “a” and has an x axis that runs from -3 to 3 and a y axis that runs from -2 to 9. The graph is of two functions. The first function is “f(x) = x squared”, which is a parabola that decreases until the origin and then increases again after the origin. The second function is “f(x) = 3(x squared)”, which is a parabola that decreases until the origin and then increases again after the origin, but is vertically stretched and thus increases at a quicker rate than the first function. The second graph is labeled “b” and has an x axis that runs from -4 to 4 and a y axis that runs from -2 to 9. The graph is of two functions. The first function is “f(x) = x squared”, which is a parabola that decreases until the origin and then increases again after the origin. The second function is “f(x) = (1/3)(x squared)”, which is a parabola that decreases until the origin and then increases again after the origin, but is vertically compressed and thus increases at a slower rate than the first function."'></div>
