<p>We can now consider one-to-one functions and show how to find their inverses. Recall that a function maps elements in the domain of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to elements in the range of <span class="process-math">\(f.\)</span> The inverse function maps each element from the range of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> back to its corresponding element from the domain of <span class="process-math">\(f.\)</span> Therefore, to find the inverse function of a one-to-one function <span class="process-math">\(f,\)</span> given any <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in the range of <span class="process-math">\(f,\)</span> we need to determine which <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in the domain of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> satisfies <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=y.\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is one-to-one, there is exactly one such value <span class="process-math">\(x.\)</span> We can find that value <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> by solving the equation <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=y\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x.\)</span> Doing so, we are able to write <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> where the domain of this function is the range of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and the range of this new function is the domain of <span class="process-math">\(f.\)</span> Consequently, this function is the inverse of <span class="process-math">\(f,\)</span> and we write <span class="process-math">\(x=f^{−1} (y).\)</span> Since we typically use the variable <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to denote the independent variable and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> to denote the dependent variable, we often interchange the roles of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y,\)</span> and write <span class="process-math">\(y=f^{−1} (x).\)</span> Representing the inverse function in this way is also helpful later when we graph a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and its inverse <span class="process-math">\(f^{−1} \)</span> on the same axes.</p>
