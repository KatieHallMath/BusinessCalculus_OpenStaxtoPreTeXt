The scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, and it can be described as follows: Consider one earthquake with magnitude <span class="process-math">\(R_1\)</span> on the Richter scale and a second earthquake with magnitude <span class="process-math">\(R_2\)</span> on the Richter scale. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(R_1\gt R_2,\)</span> which means the earthquake of magnitude <span class="process-math">\(R_1\)</span> is stronger, but how much stronger is it than the other earthquake? A way of measuring the intensity of an earthquake is by using a seismograph to measure the amplitude of the earthquake waves. If <span class="process-math">\(A_1\)</span> is the amplitude measured for the first earthquake and <span class="process-math">\(A_2\)</span> is the amplitude measured for the second earthquake, then the amplitudes and magnitudes of the two earthquakes satisfy the following equation:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
R_1−R_2=\log_{10}\left(\frac{A_1}{A_2}\right).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Consider an earthquake that measures 8 on the Richter scale and an earthquake that measures 7 on the Richter scale. Then,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
8−7=\log_{10}\left(\frac{A_1}{A_2}\right).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\log_{10}\left(\frac{A_1}{A_2}\right)=1,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which implies <span class="process-math">\(A_1/A_2=10\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(A_1=10A_2.\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(A_1\)</span> is 10 times the size of <span class="process-math">\(A_2,\)</span> we say that the first earthquake is 10 times as intense as the second earthquake. On the other hand, if one earthquake measures 8 on the Richter scale and another measures 6, then the relative intensity of the two earthquakes satisfies the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\log_{10}\left(\frac{A_1}{A_2}\right)=8−6=2.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(A_1=100A_2.\)</span> That is, the first earthquake is 100 times more intense than the second earthquake.</p>
<p>How can we use logarithmic functions to compare the relative severity of the magnitude 9 earthquake in Japan in 2011 with the magnitude 7.3 earthquake in Haiti in 2010?</p>
