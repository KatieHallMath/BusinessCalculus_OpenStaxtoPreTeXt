<p>In place of <span class="process-math">\(f'(a)\)</span> we may also use <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dy}{dx}|_{x=a}\)</span> Use of the <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dy}{dx}\)</span> notation (called Leibniz notation) is quite common in engineering and physics. To understand this notation better, recall that the derivative of a function at a point is the limit of the slopes of secant lines as the secant lines approach the tangent line. The slopes of these secant lines are often expressed in the form <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\Delta y\)</span> is the difference in the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> values corresponding to the difference in the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> values, which are expressed as <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\)</span> (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/CNX_Calc_Figure_03_02_001.html" title="Figure 3.39">FigureÂ 3.39</a>). Thus the derivative, which can be thought of as the instantaneous rate of change of <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x,\)</span> is expressed as</p>
