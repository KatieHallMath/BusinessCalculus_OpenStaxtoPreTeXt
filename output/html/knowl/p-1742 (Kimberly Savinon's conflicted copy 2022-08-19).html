<p>A picture can sometimes tell us more about a function than the results of computations. Comparing functions by their graphs as well as by their algebraic expressions can often give new insight into the process of integration. Intuitively, we might say that if a function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is above another function <span class="process-math">\(g(x),\)</span> then the area between <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> and the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis is greater than the area between <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> and the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis. This is true depending on the interval over which the comparison is made. The properties of definite integrals are valid whether <span class="process-math">\(a\lt b,a=b,\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(a\gt b.\)</span> The following properties, however, concern only the case <span class="process-math">\(a\leq b,\)</span> and are used when we want to compare the sizes of integrals.</p>
