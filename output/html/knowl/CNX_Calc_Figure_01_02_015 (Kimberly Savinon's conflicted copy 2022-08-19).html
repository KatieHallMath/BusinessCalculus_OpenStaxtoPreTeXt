The first graph is labeled “a” and has an x axis that runs from -8 to 5 and a y axis that runs from -3 to 5. The graph is of two functions. The first function is “f(x) = absolute value of x”, which decreases in a straight line until the origin and then increases in a straight line again after the origin. The second function is “f(x) = absolute value of (x + 3)”, which decreases in a straight line until the point (-3, 0) and then increases in a straight line again after the point (-3, 0). The two functions are the same in shape, but the second function is shifted left 3 units. The second graph is labeled “b” and has an x axis that runs from -5 to 8 and a y axis that runs from -3 to 5. The graph is of two functions. The first function is “f(x) = absolute value of x”, which decreases in a straight line until the origin and then increases in a straight line again after the origin. The second function is “f(x) = absolute value of (x - 3)”, which decreases in a straight line until the point (3, 0) and then increases in a straight line again after the point (3, 0).
