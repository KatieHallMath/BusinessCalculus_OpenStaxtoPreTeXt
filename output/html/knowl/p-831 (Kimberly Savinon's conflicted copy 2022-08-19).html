<p>The derivative of a function is itself a function, so we can find the derivative of a derivative. For example, the derivative of a position function is the rate of change of position, or velocity. The derivative of velocity is the rate of change of velocity, which is acceleration. The new function obtained by differentiating the derivative is called the second derivative. Furthermore, we can continue to take derivatives to obtain the third derivative, fourth derivative, and so on. Collectively, these are referred to as <dfn class="terminology">higher-order derivatives</dfn>. The notation for the higher-order derivatives of <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> can be expressed in any of the following forms:</p>
