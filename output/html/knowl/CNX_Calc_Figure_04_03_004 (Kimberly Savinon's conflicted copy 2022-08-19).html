In figure a, a parabola is shown facing down in quadrant I; there is a horizontal tangent line at the local maximum marked f’(c) = 0. In figure b, there is a function drawn with an asymptote at c, meaning that the function increases toward infinity on both sides of c; it is noted that f’(c) is undefined. In figure c, a version of the absolute value graph is shown that has been shifted so that its minimum is in quadrant I with x = c. It is noted that f’(c) is undefined. In figure d, a version of the function f(x) = x3 is shown that has been shifted so that its inflection point is in quadrant I with x = c. Its inflection point at (c, f(c)) has a horizontal line through it, and it is noted that f’(c) = 0. In figure e, a version of the function f(x) = x1/3 is shown that has been shifted so that its inflection point is in quadrant I with x = c. Its inflection point at (c, f(c)) has a vertical line through it, and it is noted that f’(c) is undefined."'></div>
