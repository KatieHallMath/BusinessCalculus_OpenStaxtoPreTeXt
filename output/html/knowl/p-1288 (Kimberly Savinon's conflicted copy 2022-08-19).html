<p>The proof of the extreme value theorem is beyond the scope of this text. Typically, it is proved in a course on real analysis. There are a couple of key points to note about the statement of this theorem. For the extreme value theorem to apply, the function must be continuous over a closed, bounded interval. If the interval <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is open or the function has even one point of discontinuity, the function may not have an absolute maximum or absolute minimum over <span class="process-math">\(I.\)</span> For example, consider the functions shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/CNX_Calc_Figure_04_03_002.html" title="Figure 4.26">FigureÂ 4.26</a>(d), (e), and (f). All three of these functions are defined over bounded intervals. However, the function in graph (e) is the only one that has both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum over its domain. The extreme value theorem cannot be applied to the functions in graphs (d) and (f) because neither of these functions is continuous over a closed, bounded interval. Although the function in graph (d) is defined over the closed interval <span class="process-math">\([0,4],\)</span> the function is discontinuous at <span class="process-math">\(x=2.\)</span> The function has an absolute maximum over <span class="process-math">\([0,4]\)</span> but does not have an absolute minimum. The function in graph (f) is continuous over the half-open interval <span class="process-math">\([0,2),\)</span> but is not defined at <span class="process-math">\(x=2,\)</span> and therefore is not continuous over a closed, bounded interval. The function has an absolute minimum over <span class="process-math">\([0,2),\)</span> but does not have an absolute maximum over <span class="process-math">\([0,2).\)</span> These two graphs illustrate why a function over a bounded interval may fail to have an absolute maximum and/or absolute minimum.</p>
