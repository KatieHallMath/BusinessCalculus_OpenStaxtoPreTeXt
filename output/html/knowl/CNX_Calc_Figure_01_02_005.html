The first graph is labeled “a” and has an x axis that runs from -4 to 5 and a y axis that runs from -4 to 6. The graph contains two functions. The first function is “f(x) = -(x squared) - 4x -4”, which is a parabola. The function increasing until it hits the maximum at the point (-2, 0) and then begins decreasing. The x intercept is at (-2, 0) and the y intercept is at (0, -4). The second function is “f(x) = 2(x squared) -12x + 16”, which is a parabola. The function decreases until it hits the minimum point at (3, -2) and then begins increasing. The x intercepts are at (2, 0) and (4, 0) and the y intercept is not shown. The second graph is labeled “b” and has an x axis that runs from -4 to 3 and a y axis that runs from -4 to 6. The graph contains two functions. The first function is “f(x) = -(x cubed) - 3(x squared) + x + 3”. The graph decreases until the approximate point at (-2.2, -3.1), then increases until the approximate point at (0.2, 3.1), then begins decreasing again. The x intercepts are at (-3, 0), (-1, 0), and (1, 0). The y intercept is at (0, 3). The second function is “f(x) = (x cubed) -3(x squared) + 3x - 1”. It is a curved function that increases until the point (1, 0), where it levels out. After this point, the function begins increasing again. It has an x intercept at (1, 0) and a y intercept at (0, -1)."'></div>
