<p>Step 1: Draw a rectangular box and introduce the variable <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to represent the length of each side of the square base; let <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> represent the height of the box. Let <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> denote the surface area of the open-top box.</p>

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">4.151<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>We want to minimize the surface area of a square-based box with a given volume.</figcaption></figure><p>Step 2: We need to minimize the surface area. Therefore, we need to minimize <span class="process-math">\(S.\)</span></p>
<p>Step 3: Since the box has an open top, we need only determine the area of the four vertical sides and the base. The area of each of the four vertical sides is <span class="process-math">\(x\cdot y.\)</span> The area of the base is <span class="process-math">\(x^2.\)</span> Therefore, the surface area of the box is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/CNX_Calc_Figure_04_07_009.html">
\begin{equation*}
S=4xy+x^2.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Step 4: Since the volume of this box is <span class="process-math">\(x^2y\)</span> and the volume is given as <span class="process-math">\(216 \text{ in. }^3,\)</span> the constraint equation is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/CNX_Calc_Figure_04_07_009.html">
\begin{equation*}
x^2y=216.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Solving the constraint equation for <span class="process-math">\(y,\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(y=\frac{216}{x^2}.\)</span> Therefore, we can write the surface area as a function of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> only:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/CNX_Calc_Figure_04_07_009.html">
\begin{equation*}
S(x)=4x\left(\frac{216}{x^2}\right)+x^2.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(S(x)=\frac{864}{x}+x^2.\)</span></p>
<p>Step 5: Since we are requiring that <span class="process-math">\(x^2y=216,\)</span> we cannot have <span class="process-math">\(x=0.\)</span> Therefore, we need <span class="process-math">\(x\gt 0.\)</span> On the other hand, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is allowed to have any positive value. Note that as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> becomes large, the height of the box <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> becomes correspondingly small so that <span class="process-math">\(x^2y=216.\)</span> Similarly, as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> becomes small, the height of the box becomes correspondingly large. We conclude that the domain is the open, unbounded interval <span class="process-math">\((0,\infty).\)</span> Note that, unlike the previous examples, we cannot reduce our problem to looking for an absolute maximum or absolute minimum over a closed, bounded interval. However, in the next step, we discover why this function must have an absolute minimum over the interval <span class="process-math">\((0,\infty).\)</span></p>
<p>Step 6: Note that as <span class="process-math">\(x\to0^+,\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(S(x)\to\infty.\)</span> Also, as <span class="process-math">\(x\to\infty,\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(S(x)\to\infty.\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a continuous function that approaches infinity at the ends, it must have an absolute minimum at some <span class="process-math">\(x\in(0,\infty).\)</span> This minimum must occur at a critical point of <span class="process-math">\(S.\)</span> The derivative is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/CNX_Calc_Figure_04_07_009.html">
\begin{equation*}
S'(x)=-\frac{864}{x^2}+2x.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(S'(x)=0\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(2x=\frac{864}{x^2}.\)</span> Solving this equation for <span class="process-math">\(x,\)</span> we obtain <span class="process-math">\(x^3=432,\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(x=\sqrt[3]{432}=6\sqrt[3]{2}.\)</span> Since this is the only critical point of <span class="process-math">\(S,\)</span> the absolute minimum must occur at <span class="process-math">\(x=6\sqrt[3]{2}\)</span> (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/CNX_Calc_Figure_04_07_009.html" title="Figure 4.152">FigureÂ 4.152</a>). When <span class="process-math">\(x=6\sqrt[3]{2},\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y=\frac{216}{(6\sqrt[3]{2})^2}=3\sqrt[3]{2} \text{ in }.\)</span> Therefore, the dimensions of the box should be <span class="process-math">\(x=6\sqrt[3]{2} \text{ in }.\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=3\sqrt[3]{2} \text{ in }.\)</span> With these dimensions, the surface area is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/CNX_Calc_Figure_04_07_009.html">
