Both graphs have an x axis that runs from -4 to 4 and a y axis that runs from -6 to 7. The first graph is labeled “a” and is of two functions. The first function is “f(x) = x to the 4th”, which is a parabola that decreases until the origin and then increases again after the origin. The second function is “f(x) = x squared”, which is a parabola that decreases until the origin and then increases again after the origin, but increases and decreases at a slower rate than the first function. The second graph is labeled “b” and is of two functions. The first function is “f(x) = x to the 5th”, which is a curved function that increases until the origin, becomes even at the origin, and then increases again after the origin. The second function is “f(x) = x cubed”, which is a curved function that increases until the origin, becomes even at the origin, and then increases again after the origin, but increases at a slower rate than the first function."'></div>
