The x axis runs from 0 to 18 and is labeled “x, hours”. The y axis runs from 0 to 32 and is labeled “y, cost in dollars”. The function consists 11 pieces, all horizontal line segments that begin with an open circle and end with a closed circle. The first piece starts at x = 0 and ends at x = 1 and is at y = 10. The second piece starts at x = 1 and ends at x = 2 and is at y = 12. The third piece starts at x = 2 and ends at x = 3 and is at y = 14. The fourth piece starts at x = 3 and ends at x = 4 and is at y = 16. The fifth piece starts at x = 4 and ends at x = 5 and is at y = 18. The sixth piece starts at x = 5 and ends at x = 6 and is at y = 20. The seventh piece starts at x = 6 and ends at x = 7 and is at y = 22. The eighth piece starts at x = 7 and ends at x = 8 and is at y = 24. The ninth piece starts at x = 8 and ends at x = 9 and is at y = 26. The tenth piece starts at x = 9 and ends at x = 10 and is at y = 28. The eleventh piece starts at x = 10 and ends at x = 18 and is at y = 30."'></div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_Ch1Sec2.html#li-208" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
