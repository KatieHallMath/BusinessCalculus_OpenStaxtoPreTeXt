Figure a shows a function increasing convexly from (a, f(a)) to (b, f(b)). At two points the derivative is taken and both are increasing, but the one taken further to the right is increasing more. It is noted that f' is increasing and f is concave up. Figure b shows a function increasing concavely from (a, f(a)) to (b, f(b)). At two points the derivative is taken and both are increasing, but the one taken further to the right is increasing less. It is noted that f' is decreasing and f is concave down. Figure c shows a function decreasing concavely from (a, f(a)) to (b, f(b)). At two points the derivative is taken and both are decreasing, but the one taken further to the right is decreasing less. It is noted that f' is increasing and f is concave up. Figure d shows a function decreasing convexly from (a, f(a)) to (b, f(b)). At two points the derivative is taken and both are decreasing, but the one taken further to the right is decreasing more. It is noted that f' is decreasing and f is concave down.&quot;"></div>
