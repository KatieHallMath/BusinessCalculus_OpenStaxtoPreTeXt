The first item is a blue bubble that has two labels: “domain of f” and “domain of g of f”. This item contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The second item is two bubbles: an orange bubble labeled “domain of g” and a blue bubble that is completely contained within the orange bubble and is labeled “range of f”. The blue bubble contains the numbers 0 and 1, which are thus also contained within the larger orange bubble. The orange bubble contains two numbers not contained within the smaller blue bubble, which are 2 and 3. The third item is two bubbles: an orange bubble labeled “range of g” and a blue bubble that is completely contained within the orange bubble and is labeled “range of g of f”. The blue bubble contains the numbers 4 and 5, which are thus also contained within the larger orange bubble. The orange bubble contains one number not contained within the smaller blue bubble, which is the number 3. The first item points has a blue arrow with the label “f” that points to the blue bubble in the second item. The orange bubble in the second item has an orange arrow labeled “g” that points the orange bubble in the third item. The first item has a blue arrow labeled “g of f” which points to the blue bubble in the third item. There are three blue arrows pointing from numbers in the first item to the numbers contained in the blue bubble of the second item. The first blue arrow points from the 1 to the 0, the second blue arrow points from the 2 to the 1, and the third blue arrow points from the 3 to the 0. There are 4 orange arrows pointing from the numbers contained in the orange bubble in the second item, including those also contained in the blue bubble of the second item, to the numbers contained in the orange bubble of the third item, including the numbers in the blue bubble of the third item. The first orange arrow points from 2 to 3, the second orange arrow points from 3 to 5, the third orange arrow points from 0 to 4, and the fourth orange arrow points from 1 to 5."'></div>
