<p>We answer the first part of this question by defining antiderivatives. The antiderivative of a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a function with a derivative <span class="process-math">\(f.\)</span> Why are we interested in antiderivatives? The need for antiderivatives arises in many situations, and we look at various examples throughout the remainder of the text. Here we examine one specific example that involves rectilinear motion. In our examination in <a href="ch_third.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Derivatives">Derivatives 3</a> of rectilinear motion, we showed that given a position function <span class="process-math">\(s(t)\)</span> of an object, then its velocity function <span class="process-math">\(v(t)\)</span> is the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(s(t)\)</span>—that is, <span class="process-math">\(v(t)=s'(t).\)</span> Furthermore, the acceleration <span class="process-math">\(a(t)\)</span> is the derivative of the velocity <span class="process-math">\(v(t)\)</span>—that is, <span class="process-math">\(a(t)=v'(t)=s\text{ ″ }(t).\)</span> Now suppose we are given an acceleration function <span class="process-math">\(a,\)</span> but not the velocity function <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> or the position function <span class="process-math">\(s.\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(a(t)=v'(t),\)</span> determining the velocity function requires us to find an antiderivative of the acceleration function. Then, since <span class="process-math">\(v(t)=s'(t),\)</span> determining the position function requires us to find an antiderivative of the velocity function. Rectilinear motion is just one case in which the need for antiderivatives arises. We will see many more examples throughout the remainder of the text. For now, let’s look at the terminology and notation for antiderivatives, and determine the antiderivatives for several types of functions. We examine various techniques for finding antiderivatives of more complicated functions later in the text, Volume 2.</p>
