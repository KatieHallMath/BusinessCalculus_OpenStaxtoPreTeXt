<p>The basic idea of the <dfn class="terminology">optimization problems</dfn> that follow is the same. We have a particular quantity that we are interested in maximizing or minimizing. However, we also have some auxiliary condition that needs to be satisfied. For example, in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fs-id1165043431956.html" title="Example 4.135: Maximizing the Area of a Garden">ExampleÂ 4.135</a>, we are interested in maximizing the area of a rectangular garden. Certainly, if we keep making the side lengths of the garden larger, the area will continue to become larger. However, what if we have some restriction on how much fencing we can use for the perimeter? In this case, we cannot make the garden as large as we like. Let's look at how we can maximize the area of a rectangle subject to some constraint on the perimeter.</p>
