<p>Recall that a function has exactly one output for each input. Therefore, to define an inverse function, we need to map each input to exactly one output. For example, letâ€™s try to find the inverse function for <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^2.\)</span> Solving the equation <span class="process-math">\(y=x^2\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x,\)</span> we arrive at the equation <span class="process-math">\(x=\pm \sqrt{y}.\)</span> This equation does not describe <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> because there are two solutions to this equation for every <span class="process-math">\(y\gt 0.\)</span> The problem with trying to find an inverse function for <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^2\)</span> is that two inputs are sent to the same output for each output <span class="process-math">\(y\gt 0.\)</span> The function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^3+4\)</span> discussed earlier did not have this problem. For that function, each input was sent to a different output. A function that sends each input to a different output is called a one-to-one function.</p>
