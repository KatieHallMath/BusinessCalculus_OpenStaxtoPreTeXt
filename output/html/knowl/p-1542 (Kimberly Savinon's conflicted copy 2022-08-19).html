<p>Step 5: Since we are requiring that <span class="process-math">\(x^2y=216,\)</span> we cannot have <span class="process-math">\(x=0.\)</span> Therefore, we need <span class="process-math">\(x\gt 0.\)</span> On the other hand, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is allowed to have any positive value. Note that as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> becomes large, the height of the box <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> becomes correspondingly small so that <span class="process-math">\(x^2y=216.\)</span> Similarly, as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> becomes small, the height of the box becomes correspondingly large. We conclude that the domain is the open, unbounded interval <span class="process-math">\((0,\infty).\)</span> Note that, unlike the previous examples, we cannot reduce our problem to looking for an absolute maximum or absolute minimum over a closed, bounded interval. However, in the next step, we discover why this function must have an absolute minimum over the interval <span class="process-math">\((0,\infty).\)</span></p>
