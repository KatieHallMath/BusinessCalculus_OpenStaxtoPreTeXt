(credit: Jeremy T. Lock)</figcaption></figure><p>Julie is an avid <dfn class="terminology">skydiver</dfn>. She has more than 300 jumps under her belt and has mastered the art of making adjustments to her body position in the air to control how fast she falls. If she arches her back and points her belly toward the ground, she reaches a terminal velocity of approximately 120 mph (176 ft/sec). If, instead, she orients her body with her head straight down, she falls faster, reaching a terminal velocity of 150 mph (220 ft/sec).</p>
<p>Since Julie will be moving (falling) in a downward direction, we assume the downward direction is positive to simplify our calculations. Julie executes her jumps from an altitude of 12,500 ft. After she exits the aircraft, she immediately starts falling at a velocity given by <span class="process-math">\(v(t)=32t.\)</span> She continues to accelerate according to this velocity function until she reaches terminal velocity. After she reaches terminal velocity, her speed remains constant until she pulls her ripcord and slows down to land.</p>
<p>On her first jump of the day, Julie orients herself in the slower “belly down” position (terminal velocity is 176 ft/sec). Using this information, answer the following questions.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>How long after she exits the aircraft does Julie reach terminal velocity?</p></li>
<li><p>Based on your answer to question 1, set up an expression involving one or more integrals that represents the distance Julie falls after 30 sec.</p></li>
<li><p>If Julie pulls her ripcord at an altitude of 3000 ft, how long does she spend in a free fall?</p></li>
<li><p>Julie pulls her ripcord at 3000 ft. It takes 5 sec for her parachute to open completely and for her to slow down, during which time she falls another 400 ft. After her canopy is fully open, her speed is reduced to 16 ft/sec. Find the total time Julie spends in the air, from the time she leaves the airplane until the time her feet touch the ground. On Julie’s second jump of the day, she decides she wants to fall a little faster and orients herself in the “head down” position. Her terminal velocity in this position is 220 ft/sec. Answer these questions based on this velocity:</p></li>
<li><p>How long does it take Julie to reach terminal velocity in this case?</p></li>
<li><p>Before pulling her ripcord, Julie reorients her body in the “belly down” position so she is not moving quite as fast when her parachute opens. If she begins this maneuver at an altitude of 4000 ft, how long does she spend in a free fall before beginning the reorientation? Some jumpers wear “<dfn class="terminology">wingsuits</dfn>” (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/CNX_Calc_Figure_05_03_006.html" title="Figure 5.80">Figure 5.80</a>). These suits have fabric panels between the arms and legs and allow the wearer to glide around in a free fall, much like a flying squirrel. (Indeed, the suits are sometimes called “flying squirrel suits.”) When wearing these suits, terminal velocity can be reduced to about 30 mph (44 ft/sec), allowing the wearers a much longer time in the air. Wingsuit flyers still use parachutes to land; although the vertical velocities are within the margin of safety, horizontal velocities can exceed 70 mph, much too fast to land safely.</p></li>
