The function consists 11 pieces, all horizontal line segments that begin with an open circle and end with a closed circle. The first piece starts at x = 0 and ends at x = 1 and is at y = 10. The second piece starts at x = 1 and ends at x = 2 and is at y = 12. The third piece starts at x = 2 and ends at x = 3 and is at y = 14. The fourth piece starts at x = 3 and ends at x = 4 and is at y = 16. The fifth piece starts at x = 4 and ends at x = 5 and is at y = 18. The sixth piece starts at x = 5 and ends at x = 6 and is at y = 20. The seventh piece starts at x = 6 and ends at x = 7 and is at y = 22. The eighth piece starts at x = 7 and ends at x = 8 and is at y = 24. The ninth piece starts at x = 8 and ends at x = 9 and is at y = 26.
