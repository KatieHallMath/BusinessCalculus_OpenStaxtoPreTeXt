Figure a shows a function increasing convexly from (a, f(a)) to (b, f(b)). At two points the derivative is taken and it is noted that at both f' \gt  0. In other words, f is increasing. Figure b shows a function increasing concavely from (a, f(a)) to (b, f(b)). At two points the derivative is taken and it is noted that at both f' \gt  0. In other words, f is increasing. Figure c shows a function decreasing concavely from (a, f(a)) to (b, f(b)). At two points the derivative is taken and it is noted that at both f' \lt  0. In other words, f is decreasing. Figure d shows a function decreasing convexly from (a, f(a)) to (b, f(b)). At two points the derivative is taken and it is noted that at both f' \lt  0. In other words, f is decreasing.&quot;"></div>
