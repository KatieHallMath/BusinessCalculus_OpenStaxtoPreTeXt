</h4>
<p>If <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is continuous over an interval <span class="process-math">\([a,b],\)</span> and the function <span class="process-math">\(F(x)\)</span> is defined by</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
F(x)=\displaystyle{ \int_{a}^{x} f(t)dt},
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>then <span class="process-math">\(F'(x)=f(x)\)</span> over <span class="process-math">\([a,b].\)</span></p>
<p>Before we delve into the proof, a couple of subtleties are worth mentioning here. First, a comment on the notation. Note that we have defined a function, <span class="process-math">\(F(x),\)</span> as the definite integral of another function, <span class="process-math">\(f(t),\)</span> from the point <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> to the point <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> At first glance, this is confusing, because we have said several times that a definite integral is a number, and here it looks like itâ€™s a function. The key here is to notice that for any particular value of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> the definite integral is a number. So the function <span class="process-math">\(F(x)\)</span> returns a number (the value of the definite integral) for each value of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Second, it is worth commenting on some of the key implications of this theorem. There is a reason it is called the <em class="emphasis">Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</em>. Not only does it establish a relationship between integration and differentiation, but also it guarantees that any integrable function has an antiderivative. Specifically, it guarantees that any continuous function has an antiderivative.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_Ch5Sec3.html#fs-id1170571704350" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
