<p>We conclude that we can determine the concavity of a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> by looking at the second derivative of <span class="process-math">\(f.\)</span> In addition, we observe that a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> can switch concavity (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/CNX_Calc_Figure_04_05_006.html" title="Figure 4.73">FigureÂ 4.73</a>). However, a continuous function can switch concavity only at a point <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)=0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> is undefined. Consequently, to determine the intervals where a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is concave up and concave down, we look for those values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)=0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> is undefined. When we have determined these points, we divide the domain of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> into smaller intervals and determine the sign of <span class="process-math">\(f''\)</span> over each of these smaller intervals. If <span class="process-math">\(f''\)</span> changes sign as we pass through a point <span class="process-math">\(x,\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> changes concavity. It is important to remember that a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> may not change concavity at a point <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> even if <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)=0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> is undefined. If, however, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> does change concavity at a point <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous at <span class="process-math">\(a,\)</span> we say the point <span class="process-math">\((a,f(a))\)</span> is an inflection point of <span class="process-math">\(f.\)</span></p>
