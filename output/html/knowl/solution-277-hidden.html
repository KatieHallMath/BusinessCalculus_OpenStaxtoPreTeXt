<p>Step 1: Let <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> be the price charged per car per day and let <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> be the number of cars rented per day. Let <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> be the revenue per day.</p>
<p>Step 2: The problem is to maximize <span class="process-math">\(R.\)</span></p>
<p>Step 3: The revenue (per day) is equal to the number of cars rented per day times the price charged per car per dayâ€”that is, <span class="process-math">\(R=n \times  p.\)</span></p>
<p>Step 4: Since the number of cars rented per day is modeled by the linear function <span class="process-math">\(n(p)=1000-5p,\)</span> the revenue <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> can be represented by the function</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
R(p)=n \times  p=(1000-5p)p=-5p^2+1000p.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Step 5: Since the owners plan to charge between <span class="process-math">\(\$ 50\)</span> per car per day and <span class="process-math">\(\$ 200\)</span> per car per day, the problem is to find the maximum revenue <span class="process-math">\(R(p)\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> in the closed interval <span class="process-math">\([50,200].\)</span></p>
<p>Step 6: Since <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval <span class="process-math">\([50,200],\)</span> it has an absolute maximum (and an absolute minimum) in that interval. To find the maximum value, look for critical points. The derivative is <span class="process-math">\(R'(p)=-10p+1000.\)</span> Therefore, the critical point is <span class="process-math">\(p=100\)</span> When <span class="process-math">\(p=100,\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(R(100)=\$ 50,000.\)</span> When <span class="process-math">\(p=50,\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(R(p)=\$ 37,500.\)</span> When <span class="process-math">\(p=200,\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(R(p)=\$ 0.\)</span> Therefore, the absolute maximum occurs at <span class="process-math">\(p=\$ 100.\)</span> The car rental company should charge <span class="process-math">\(\$ 100\)</span> per day per car to maximize revenue as shown in the following figure.</p>
