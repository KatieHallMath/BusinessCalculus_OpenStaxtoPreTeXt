<p>Now that we have both a conceptual understanding of a limit and the practical ability to compute limits, we have established the foundation for our study of calculus, the branch of mathematics in which we compute derivatives and integrals. Most mathematicians and historians agree that calculus was developed independently by the Englishman Isaac <dfn class="terminology">Newton</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(\text{ (1643–1727) }\)</span> and the German Gottfried <dfn class="terminology">Leibniz</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(\text{ (1646–1716), }\)</span> whose images appear in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/CNX_Calc_Figure_03_01_001.html" title="Figure 3.2">Figure 3.2</a>. When we credit Newton and Leibniz with developing calculus, we are really referring to the fact that Newton and Leibniz were the first to understand the relationship between the derivative and the integral. Both mathematicians benefited from the work of predecessors, such as Barrow, Fermat, and Cavalieri. The initial relationship between the two mathematicians appears to have been amicable; however, in later years a bitter controversy erupted over whose work took precedence. Although it seems likely that Newton did, indeed, arrive at the ideas behind calculus first, we are indebted to Leibniz for the notation that we commonly use today.</p>
