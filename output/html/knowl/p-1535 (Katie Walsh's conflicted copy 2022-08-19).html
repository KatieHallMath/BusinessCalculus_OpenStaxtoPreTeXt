<p>Consider the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=2x.\)</span> Knowing the power rule of differentiation, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(F(x)=x^2\)</span> is an antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(F'(x)=2x.\)</span> Are there any other antiderivatives of <span class="process-math">\(f?\)</span> Yes; since the derivative of any constant <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is zero, <span class="process-math">\(x^2+C\)</span> is also an antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(2x.\)</span> Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(x^2+5\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x^2-\sqrt{2}\)</span> are also antiderivatives. Are there any others that are not of the form <span class="process-math">\(x^2+C\)</span> for some constant <span class="process-math">\(C?\)</span> The answer is no. From Corollary <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> of the Mean Value Theorem, we know that if <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> are differentiable functions such that <span class="process-math">\(F'(x)=G'(x),\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(F(x)-G(x)=C\)</span> for some constant <span class="process-math">\(C.\)</span> This fact leads to the following important theorem.</p>
