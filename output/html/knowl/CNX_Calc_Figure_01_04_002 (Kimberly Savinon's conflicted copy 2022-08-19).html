Both graphs have an x axis that runs from -3 to 3 and a y axis that runs from -3 to 4. The first graph is of the function “f(x) = x squared”, which is a parabola. The function decreases until it hits the origin, where it begins to increase. The x intercept and y intercept are both at the origin. There are two orange horizontal lines also plotted on the graph, both of which run through the function at two points each. The second graph is of the function “f(x) = x cubed”, which is an increasing curved function. The x intercept and y intercept are both at the origin. There are three orange lines also plotted on the graph, each of which only intersects the function at one point."'></div>
