<p><dfn class="terminology">Archimedes</dfn> was fascinated with calculating the areas of various shapesâ€”in other words, the amount of space enclosed by the shape. He used a process that has come to be known as the <dfn class="terminology">method of exhaustion</dfn>, which used smaller and smaller shapes, the areas of which could be calculated exactly, to fill an irregular region and thereby obtain closer and closer approximations to the total area. In this process, an area bounded by curves is filled with rectangles, triangles, and shapes with exact area formulas. These areas are then summed to approximate the area of the curved region.</p>
