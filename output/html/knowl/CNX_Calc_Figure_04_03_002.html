In figure a, the line f(x) = x3 is shown, and it is noted that it has no absolute minimum and no absolute maximum. In figure b, the line f(x) = 1/(x2 + 1) is shown, which is near 0 for most of its length and rises to a bump at (0, 1); it has no absolute minimum, but does have an absolute maximum of 1 at x = 0. In figure c, the line f(x) = cos x is shown, which has absolute minimums of −1 at ±π, ±3π, … and absolute maximums of 1 at 0, ±2π, ±4π, …. In figure d, the piecewise function f(x) = 2 – x2 for 0 ≤ x \lt  2 and x – 3 for 2 ≤ x ≤ 4 is shown, with absolute maximum of 2 at x = 0 and no absolute minimum. In figure e, the function f(x) = (x – 2)2 is shown on [1, 4], which has absolute maximum of 4 at x = 4 and absolute minimum of 0 at x = 2. In figure f, the function f(x) = x/(2 − x) is shown on [0, 2), with absolute minimum of 0 at x = 0 and no absolute maximum."'></div>
