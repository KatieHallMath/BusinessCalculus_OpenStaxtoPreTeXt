<p>We found that <span class="process-math">\(E(0.75)=0.6=\frac{0.6}{1}=\frac{3}{5} \)</span> so we can either say that a 1% increase in price leads to a 0.6% decrease in demand or, similarly, that a 5% increase in price leads to a 3% decrease in demand.</p>
<p>We found that <span class="process-math">\(E(1.50)=3=\frac{3}{1} \)</span> so we can say that a 1% increase in price leads to a 3% decrease in demand.</p>
<p>We found that <span class="process-math">\(E(1.00)=1=\frac{1}{1} \)</span> so we can say that a 1% increase in price leads to a 1% decrease in demand.</p>
<p>There's a few things to note here. First, there are lots of equivalent fractions so, for example, since we can write <span class="process-math">\(E(1.50)=3=\frac{6}{2} \text{,}\)</span> we could have also said a 2% increase in price leads to a 6% decrease in demand. Second, we can also switch which quantities are increasing and decreasing. So, for example, for <span class="process-math">\(E(0.75)=\frac{3}{5} \text{,}\)</span> we get that a 5% <em class="emphasis">decrease</em> in price leads to a <span class="process-math">\(3% \)</span> <em class="emphasis">increase</em> in demand.</p>
