<p>In 1935, Charles Richter developed a scale (now known as the <dfn class="terminology">Richter scale</dfn>) to measure the magnitude of an <dfn class="terminology">earthquake</dfn>. The scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, and it can be described as follows: Consider one earthquake with magnitude <span class="process-math">\(R_1\)</span> on the Richter scale and a second earthquake with magnitude <span class="process-math">\(R_2\)</span> on the Richter scale. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(R_1\gt R_2,\)</span> which means the earthquake of magnitude <span class="process-math">\(R_1\)</span> is stronger, but how much stronger is it than the other earthquake? A way of measuring the intensity of an earthquake is by using a seismograph to measure the amplitude of the earthquake waves. If <span class="process-math">\(A_1\)</span> is the amplitude measured for the first earthquake and <span class="process-math">\(A_2\)</span> is the amplitude measured for the second earthquake, then the amplitudes and magnitudes of the two earthquakes satisfy the following equation:</p>
