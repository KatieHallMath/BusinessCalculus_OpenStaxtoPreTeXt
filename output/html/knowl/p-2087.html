<p>In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fs-id1167793455088.html" title="Example 6.16: Finding the Area of a Complex Region">Example 6.16</a>, we had to evaluate two separate integrals to calculate the area of the region. However, there is another approach that requires only one integral. What if we treat the curves as functions of <span class="process-math">\(y,\)</span> instead of as functions of <span class="process-math">\(x?\)</span> Review <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/CNX_Calc_Figure_06_01_006.html" title="Figure 6.17">Figure 6.17</a>. Note that the left graph, shown in red, is represented by the function <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)=x^2.\)</span> We could just as easily solve this for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and represent the curve by the function <span class="process-math">\(x=v(y)=\sqrt{y}.\)</span> (Note that <span class="process-math">\(x=- \sqrt{y}\)</span> is also a valid representation of the function <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)=x^2\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(y.\)</span> However, based on the graph, it is clear we are interested in the positive square root.) Similarly, the right graph is represented by the function <span class="process-math">\(y=g(x)=2-x,\)</span> but could just as easily be represented by the function <span class="process-math">\(x=u(y)=2-y.\)</span> When the graphs are represented as functions of <span class="process-math">\(y,\)</span> we see the region is bounded on the left by the graph of one function and on the right by the graph of the other function. Therefore, if we integrate with respect to <span class="process-math">\(y,\)</span> we need to evaluate one integral only. Let’s develop a formula for this type of integration.</p>
