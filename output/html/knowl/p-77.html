<p>When we compose functions, we take a function of a function. For example, suppose the temperature <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> on a given day is described as a function of time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> (measured in hours after midnight) as in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fs-id1170572114646.html" title="Table 1.12: Temperature as a Function of Time of Day">TableÂ 1.12</a>. Suppose the cost <span class="process-math">\(C,\)</span> to heat or cool a building for 1 hour, can be described as a function of the temperature <span class="process-math">\(T.\)</span> Combining these two functions, we can describe the cost of heating or cooling a building as a function of time by evaluating <span class="process-math">\(C(T(t)).\)</span> We have defined a new function, denoted <span class="process-math">\(C\circ T,\)</span> which is defined such that <span class="process-math">\((C\circ T)(t)=C(T(t))\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> in the domain of <span class="process-math">\(T.\)</span> This new function is called a composite function. We note that since cost is a function of temperature and temperature is a function of time, it makes sense to define this new function <span class="process-math">\((C\circ T)(t).\)</span> It does not make sense to consider <span class="process-math">\((T\circ C)(t),\)</span> because temperature is not a function of cost.</p>
