</h5>Before pulling her ripcord, Julie reorients her body in the “belly down” position so she is not moving quite as fast when her parachute opens. If she begins this maneuver at an altitude of 4000 ft, how long does she spend in a free fall before beginning the reorientation? Some jumpers wear “<dfn class="terminology">wingsuits</dfn>” (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/CNX_Calc_Figure_05_03_006.html" title="Figure 5.80">Figure 5.80</a>). These suits have fabric panels between the arms and legs and allow the wearer to glide around in a free fall, much like a flying squirrel. (Indeed, the suits are sometimes called “flying squirrel suits.”) When wearing these suits, terminal velocity can be reduced to about 30 mph (44 ft/sec), allowing the wearers a much longer time in the air. Wingsuit flyers still use parachutes to land; although the vertical velocities are within the margin of safety, horizontal velocities can exceed 70 mph, much too fast to land safely.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_Ch5Sec3.html#li-708" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
