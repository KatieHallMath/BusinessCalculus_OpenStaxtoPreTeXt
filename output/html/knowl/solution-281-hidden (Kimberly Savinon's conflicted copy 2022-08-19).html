<p>Step 1: Draw a rectangular box and introduce the variable <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to represent the length of each side of the square base; let <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> represent the height of the box. Let <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> denote the cost of producing the box.</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/Busi_Calc_Figure_04_07_003%20.jpg" class="contained" alt='"A box with square base is shown. The base has side length x, and the height is h."'></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">4.154<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>We want to minimize the cost to produce a square-based box with a given volume.</figcaption></figure>--&gt; <p>Step 2: We need to minimize the cost. Therefore, we need to minimize <span class="process-math">\(C.\)</span></p>
<p>Step 3: We need to determine the cost of the four vertical sides, the top, and the base. In order to find the cost, we must first find the surface area of the box. The area of each of the four vertical sides is <span class="process-math">\(x\cdot h.\)</span> The area of the base and top are both <span class="process-math">\(x^2.\)</span> Since the cost to produce the top and sides of this box is $2 per square foot and the cost to produce the bottom is $6 per square foot, then the cost is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/Busi_Calc_Figure_04_07_002.html">
\begin{equation*}
C=2x^2+8xh+6x^2=8x^2+8xh
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Step 4: Since the volume of this box is <span class="process-math">\(x^2h\)</span> and the volume is given as <span class="process-math">\(128\)</span> cubic ft, the constraint equation is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/Busi_Calc_Figure_04_07_002.html">
\begin{equation*}
x^2h=128.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Solving the constraint equation for <span class="process-math">\(h,\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(h=\frac{128}{x^2}.\)</span> Therefore, we can write the cost as a function of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> only:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/Busi_Calc_Figure_04_07_002.html">
\begin{equation*}
C(x)=8x^2+8x\cdot\frac{128}{x^2}=8x^2+\frac{1024}{x}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Step 5: Since we are requiring that <span class="process-math">\(x^2h=128,\)</span> we cannot have <span class="process-math">\(x=0.\)</span> Therefore, we need <span class="process-math">\(x\gt 0.\)</span> On the other hand, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is allowed to have any positive value. Note that as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> becomes large, the height of the box <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> becomes correspondingly small so that <span class="process-math">\(x^2h=128.\)</span> Similarly, as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> becomes small, the height of the box becomes correspondingly large. We conclude that the domain is the open, unbounded interval <span class="process-math">\((0,\infty).\)</span> Note that, unlike the previous examples, we cannot reduce our problem to looking for an absolute maximum or absolute minimum over a closed, bounded interval. However, in the next step, we discover why this function must have an absolute minimum over the interval <span class="process-math">\((0,\infty).\)</span></p>
<p>Step 6: Note that as <span class="process-math">\(x\to0^+,\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\to\infty.\)</span> Also, as <span class="process-math">\(x\to\infty,\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\to\infty.\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is a continuous function that approaches infinity at the ends, it must have an absolute minimum at some <span class="process-math">\(x\in(0,\infty).\)</span> This minimum must occur at a critical point of <span class="process-math">\(C.\)</span> The derivative is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/Busi_Calc_Figure_04_07_002.html">
\begin{equation*}
C'(x)=16x-\frac{1024}{x^2}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(C'(x)=0\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(16x=\frac{1024}{x^2}.\)</span> Solving this equation for <span class="process-math">\(x,\)</span> we obtain <span class="process-math">\(x^3=64,\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(x=4.\)</span> Since this is the only critical point of <span class="process-math">\(C,\)</span> the absolute minimum must occur at <span class="process-math">\(x=4\)</span> (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Busi_Calc_Figure_04_07_002.html" title="Figure 4.155">FigureÂ 4.155</a>). When <span class="process-math">\(x=4,\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(h=\frac{128}{4^2}=8\)</span> feet. Therefore, the dimensions of the box should be <span class="process-math">\(x=4\)</span> feet and <span class="process-math">\(h=8\)</span> feet. With these dimensions, the cost is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/Busi_Calc_Figure_04_07_002.html">
\begin{equation*}
C(4)=8(4)^2+\frac{1024}{4}=\$384.
