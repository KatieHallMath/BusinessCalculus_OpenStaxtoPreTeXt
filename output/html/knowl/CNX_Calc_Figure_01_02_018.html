Both graphs have an x axis that runs from -3 to 3 and a y axis that runs from -5 to 6. The first graph is labeled “a” and is of two functions. The first graph is of two functions. The first function is “f(x) = x cubed + 1”, which is a curved increasing function that has an x intercept at (-1, 0) and a y intercept at (0, 1). The second function is “f(x) = -(x cubed + 1)”, which is a curved decreasing function that has an x intercept at (-1, 0) and a y intercept at (0, -1). The second graph is labeled “b” and is of two functions. The first function is “f(x) = x cubed + 1”, which is a curved increasing function that has an x intercept at (-1, 0) and a y intercept at (0, 1). The second function is “f(x) = (-x) cubed + 1”, which is a curved decreasing function that has an x intercept at (1, 0) and a y intercept at (0, 1). The first function increases at the same rate the second function decreases for the same values of x."'></div>
