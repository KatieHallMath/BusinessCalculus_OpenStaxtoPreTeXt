<p>So far, we have studied functions of one variable only. Such functions can be represented visually using graphs in two dimensions; however, there is no good reason to restrict our investigation to two dimensions. Suppose, for example, that instead of determining the velocity of an object moving along a coordinate axis, we want to determine the velocity of a rock fired from a catapult at a given time, or of an airplane moving in three dimensions. We might want to graph real-value functions of two variables or determine volumes of solids of the type shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/CNX_Calc_Figure_02_01_010.html" title="Figure 2.21">FigureÂ 2.21</a>. These are only a few of the types of questions that can be asked and answered using <dfn class="terminology">multivariable calculus</dfn>. Informally, multivariable calculus can be characterized as the study of the calculus of functions of two or more variables. However, before exploring these and other ideas, we must first lay a foundation for the study of calculus in one variable by exploring the concept of a limit.</p>
