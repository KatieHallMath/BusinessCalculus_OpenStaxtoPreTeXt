<p>A continuous function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a local maximum at point <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> switches from increasing to decreasing at point <span class="process-math">\(c.\)</span> Similarly, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a local minimum at <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> switches from decreasing to increasing at <span class="process-math">\(c.\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a continuous function over an interval <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> and differentiable over <span class="process-math">\(I,\)</span> except possibly at <span class="process-math">\(c,\)</span> the only way <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> can switch from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) at point <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is if <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> changes sign as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases through <span class="process-math">\(c.\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(c,\)</span> the only way that <span class="process-math">\(f'.\)</span> can change sign as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases through <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is if <span class="process-math">\(f'(c)=0.\)</span> Therefore, for a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> that is continuous over an interval <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> and differentiable over <span class="process-math">\(I,\)</span> except possibly at <span class="process-math">\(c,\)</span> the only way <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> can switch from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) is if <span class="process-math">\(f(c)=0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(f'(c)\)</span> is undefined. Consequently, to locate local extrema for a function <span class="process-math">\(f,\)</span> we look for points <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> in the domain of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f(c)=0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(f'(c)\)</span> is undefined. Recall that such points are called critical points of <span class="process-math">\(f.\)</span></p>
