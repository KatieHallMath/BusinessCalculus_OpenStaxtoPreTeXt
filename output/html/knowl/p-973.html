<p>To put this rule into context, letâ€™s take a look at an example: <span class="process-math">\(h(x)=h(x)=(9x+1)^2.\)</span> We can think of the derivative of this function with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as the rate of change of <span class="process-math">\((9x+1)^2\)</span> relative to the change in <span class="process-math">\(x.\)</span> Consequently, we want to know how <span class="process-math">\((9x+1)^2\)</span> changes as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> changes. We can think of this event as a chain reaction: As <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> changes, <span class="process-math">\(9x+1\)</span> changes, which leads to a change in <span class="process-math">\((9x+1)^2.\)</span> This chain reaction gives us hints as to what is involved in computing the derivative of <span class="process-math">\((9x+1)^2.\)</span> First of all, a change in <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> forcing a change in <span class="process-math">\(9x+1\)</span> suggests that somehow the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(9x+1\)</span> is involved. In addition, the change in <span class="process-math">\(9x+1\)</span> forcing a change in <span class="process-math">\((9x+1)^2\)</span> suggests that the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(u^2\)</span> with respect to <span class="process-math">\(u,\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(u=9x+1,\)</span> is also part of the final derivative.</p>
