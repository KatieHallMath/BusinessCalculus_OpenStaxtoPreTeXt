<p id="p-114">We have studied the general characteristics of functions, so now let's examine some specific classes of functions. We begin by reviewing the basic properties of linear and quadratic functions, and then generalize to include higher-degree polynomials. By combining root functions with polynomials, we can define general algebraic functions and distinguish them from the transcendental functions we examine later in this chapter. We finish the section with examples of piecewise-defined functions and take a look at how to sketch the graph of a function that has been shifted, stretched, or reflected from its initial form.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-7"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<p id="p-115">The easiest type of function to consider is a <dfn class="terminology">linear function</dfn>. Linear functions have the form <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=ax+b,\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are constants. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/CNX_Calc_Figure_01_02_001.html" title="Figure 1.47">Figure 1.47</a>, we see examples of linear functions when <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is positive, negative, and zero. Note that if <span class="process-math">\(a\gt  0 ,\)</span> the graph of the line rises as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases. In other words, <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=ax+b\)</span> is increasing on <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,\infty).\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(a\lt  0 ,\)</span> the graph of the line falls as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases. In this case, <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=ax+b\)</span> is decreasing on <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,\infty).\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(a= 0 ,\)</span> the line is horizontal.</p>

If the slope is positive, the line points upward when moving from left to right. If the slope is negative, the line points downward when moving from left to right.

</h4>
<p id="p-144">To determine the behavior of a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> as the inputs approach infinity, we look at the values <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> as the inputs, <span class="process-math">\(x,\)</span> become larger. For some functions, the values of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> approach a finite number. For example, for the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)= 2 + 1  /x,\)</span> the values <span class="process-math">\(1  /x\)</span> become closer and closer to zero for all values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as they get larger and larger. For this function, we say "<span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> approaches two as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> goes to infinity,"" and we write <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\to  2 \)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x\to \infty.\)</span> The line <span class="process-math">\(y= 2 \)</span> is a horizontal asymptote for the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)= 2 + 1  /x\)</span> because the graph of the function gets closer to the line as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> gets larger.</p>
<p id="p-145">For other functions, the values <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> may not approach a finite number but instead may become larger for all values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as they get larger. In that case, we say "<span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> approaches infinity as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approaches infinity," and we write <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\to \infty\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x\to \infty.\)</span> For example, for the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)= 3 x^2 ,\)</span> the outputs <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> become larger as the inputs <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> get larger. We can conclude that the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)= 3 x^2 \)</span> approaches infinity as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approaches infinity, and we write <span class="process-math">\(3 x^2 \to \infty\)</span> as<span class="process-math">\(x\to \infty.\)</span> The behavior as <span class="process-math">\(x\to -\infty\)</span> and the meaning of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\to -\infty\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x\to \infty\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x\to -\infty\)</span> can be defined similarly.

<p id="p-146">To understand the end behavior for polynomial functions, we can focus on quadratic and cubic functions. The behavior for higher-degree polynomials can be analyzed similarly.

<p id="p-165">By allowing for quotients and fractional powers in polynomial functions, we create a larger class of functions. An <dfn class="terminology">algebraic function</dfn> is one that involves addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, rational powers, and roots. Two types of algebraic functions are rational functions and root functions.</p>
<p id="p-166">Just as rational numbers are quotients of integers, rational functions are quotients of polynomials. In particular, a <dfn class="terminology">rational function</dfn> is any function of the form <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=p(x) /q(x),\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(p(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q(x)\)</span> are polynomials.

For example, <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^{1/2}=\sqrt{x}\)</span> is the square-root function and <span class="process-math">\(g(x)=x^{1/3}=\sqrt[3]{x}\)</span> is the cube-root function. By allowing for compositions of root functions and rational functions, we can create other algebraic functions.

<p id="p-180">Thus far, we have discussed algebraic functions. Some functions, however, cannot be described by basic algebraic operations. These functions are known as <dfn class="terminology">transcendental functions</dfn> because they are said to “transcend,” or go beyond, algebra.

<p id="p-184">Sometimes a function is defined by different formulas on different parts of its domain. A function with this property is known as a <dfn class="terminology">piecewise-defined function</dfn>. The absolute value function is an example of a piecewise-defined function because the formula changes with the sign of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{:}\)</span></p>

<p id="p-185">Other piecewise-defined functions may be represented by completely different formulas, depending on the part of the domain in which a point falls. To graph a piecewise-defined function, we graph each part of the function in its respective domain, on the same coordinate system. If the formula for a function is different for <span class="process-math">\(x\lt a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\gt a,\)</span> we need to pay special attention to what happens at <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> when we graph the function.
