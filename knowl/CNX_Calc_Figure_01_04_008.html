The first graph is of “y = f(x)”, which is a curved increasing function, that increases at a faster rate as x increases. The point (a, b) is on the graph of the function in the first quadrant. The second graph also graphs “y = f(x)” with the point (a, b), but also graphs the function “y = f inverse (x)”, an increasing curved function, that increases at a slower rate as x increases. This function includes the point (b, a). In addition to the two functions, there is a diagonal dotted line potted with the equation “y =x”, which shows that “f(x)” and “f inverse (x)” are mirror images about the line “y =x”."'></div>
