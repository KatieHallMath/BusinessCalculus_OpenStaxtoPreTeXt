<p>As we have seen, <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^2\)</span> does not have an inverse function because it is not one-to-one. However, we can choose a subset of the domain of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> such that the function is one-to-one. This subset is called a <dfn class="terminology">restricted domain</dfn>. By restricting the domain of <span class="process-math">\(f,\)</span> we can define a new function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> such that the domain of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is the restricted domain of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(x)=f(x)\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in the domain of <span class="process-math">\(g.\)</span> Then we can define an inverse function for <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> on that domain. For example, since <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^2\)</span> is one-to-one on the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,\infty ),\)</span> we can define a new function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> such that the domain of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\([0,\infty )\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(x)=x^2\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in its domain. Since <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is a one-to-one function, it has an inverse function, given by the formula <span class="process-math">\(g^{-1}(x)=\sqrt{x}.\)</span> On the other hand, the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^2\)</span> is also one-to-one on the domain <span class="process-math">\((-\infty ,0].\)</span> Therefore, we could also define a new function <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> such that the domain of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\((-\infty ,0]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h(x)=x^2\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in the domain of <span class="process-math">\(h.\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is a one-to-one function and must also have an inverse. Its inverse is given by the formula <span class="process-math">\(h^{-1}(x)=-\sqrt{x}\)</span> (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/CNX_Calc_Figure_01_04_012.html" title="Figure 1.109">FigureÂ 1.109</a>).</p>
