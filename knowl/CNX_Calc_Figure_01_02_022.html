The first graph is labeled “a” and has an x axis that runs from -2 to 9 and a y axis that runs from -4 to 4. The first graph is of two functions. The first function is “f(x) = square root of x”, which is a curved function that begins at the origin and increases. The second function is “f(x) = x to the 4th root”, which is a curved function that begins at the origin and increases, but increases at a slower rate than the first function. The second graph is labeled “b” and has an x axis that runs from -8 to 8 and a y axis that runs from -4 to 4. The second graph is of two functions. The first function is “f(x) = cube root of x”, which is a curved function that increases until the origin, becomes vertical at the origin, and then increases again after the origin. The second function is “f(x) = x to the 5th root”, which is a curved function that increases until the origin, becomes vertical at the origin, and then increases again after the origin, but increases at a slower rate than the first function."'></div>
