The first graph is labeled “a” and has an x axis that runs from -4 to 4 and a y axis that runs from -1 to 10. The graph is of two functions. The first function is “f(x) = x squared”, which is a parabola that decreases until the origin and then increases again after the origin. The second function is “f(x) = (x squared) + 4”, which is a parabola that decreases until the point (0, 4) and then increases again after the origin. The two functions are the same in shape, but the second function is shifted up 4 units. The second graph is labeled “b” and has an x axis that runs from -4 to 4 and a y axis that runs from -5 to 6. The graph is of two functions. The first function is “f(x) = x squared”, which is a parabola that decreases until the origin and then increases again after the origin. The second function is “f(x) = (x squared) - 4”, which is a parabola that decreases until the point (0, -4) and then increases again after the origin. The two functions are the same in shape, but the second function is shifted down 4 units."'></div>
