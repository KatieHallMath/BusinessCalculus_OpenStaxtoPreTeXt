<p>For example, consider the function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> where the domain is the set of all real numbers and the rule is to square the input. Then, the input <span class="process-math">\(x=3\)</span> is assigned to the output <span class="process-math">\(3^2=9\text{.}\)</span> Since every nonnegative real number has a real-value square root, every nonnegative number is an element of the range of this function. Since there is no real number with a square that is negative, the negative real numbers are not elements of the range. We conclude that the range is the set of nonnegative real numbers. For a general function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> with domain <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> we often use <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to denote the input and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> to denote the output associated with <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> When doing so, we refer to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as the <dfn class="terminology">independent variable</dfn> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> as the <dfn class="terminology">dependent variable</dfn>, because it depends on <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Using function notation, we write <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> and we read this equation as “<span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> equals <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>” For the squaring function described earlier, we write <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^2.\)</span></p>
