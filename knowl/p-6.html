<p>Given two sets <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> a set with elements that are ordered pairs <span class="process-math">\((x,y) \)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an element of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is an element of <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> is a relation from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span>   to <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> A relation from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> defines a relationship between those two sets. A function is a special type of relation in which each element of the first set is related to exactly one element of the second set. The element of the first set is called the <em class="emphasis">input</em>; the element of the second set is called the <em class="emphasis">output</em>. Functions are used all the time in mathematics to describe relationships between two sets. For any function, when we know the input, the output is determined, so we say that the output is a function of the input. For example, the area of a square is determined by its side length, so we say that the area (the output) is a function of its side length (the input). The velocity of a ball thrown in the air can be described as a function of the amount of time the ball is in the air. The cost of mailing a package is a function of the weight of the package. Since functions have so many uses, it is important to have precise definitions and terminology to study them.</p>
