The second function is “f(x) = absolute value of (x + 2)”, which decreases in a straight line until the point (-2, 0) and then increases in a straight line again after the point (-2, 0). The second function is the same shape as the first function, but is shifted left 2 units. The third function is “f(x) = -(absolute value of (x + 2))”, which increases in a straight line until the point (-2, 0) and then decreases in a straight line again after the point (-2, 0). The third function is the second function reflected about the x axis. The fourth function is “f(x) = -(absolute value of (x + 2)) - 3” and is labeled “transformed function”. It increases in a straight line until the point (-2, -3) and then decreases in a straight line again after the point (-2, -3). The fourth function is the third function shifted down 3 units."'></div>

The x axis runs from -7 to 7 and a y axis runs from -2 to 10. The graph contains four functions. The first function is “f(x) = square root of x” and is labeled starting function. It is a curved function that begins at the origin and increases. The second function is “f(x) = square root of -x”, which is a curved function that decreases until it reaches the origin, where it stops. The second function is the first function reflected about the y axis. The third function is “f(x) = 3(square root of -x)”, which is a curved function that decreases until it reaches the origin, where it stops. The third function decreases at a quicker rate than the second function. The fourth function is “f(x) = 3(square root of -x) + 1” and is labeled “transformed function”.
