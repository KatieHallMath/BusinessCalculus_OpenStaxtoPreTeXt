<li>Since the horizontal line <span class="process-math">\(y=n\)</span> for any integer <span class="process-math">\(n\geq 0\)</span> intersects the graph more than once, this function is not one-to-one. <div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/CNX_Calc_Figure_01_04_005.jpg" class="contained" alt='"An image of a graph. The x axis runs from -3 to 11 and the y axis runs from -3 to 11. The graph is of a step function which contains 10 horizontal steps. Each steps starts with a closed circle and ends with an open circle. The first step starts at the origin and ends at the point (1, 0). The second step starts at the point (1, 1) and ends at the point (1, 2). Each of the following 8 steps starts 1 unit higher in the y direction than where the previous step ended. The tenth and final step starts at the point (9, 9) and ends at the point (10, 9). There are also two horizontal orange lines plotted on the graph, each of which run through an entire step of the function."'></div>

<li>Since every horizontal line intersects the graph once (at most), this function is one-to-one. <div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/CNX_Calc_Figure_01_04_006.jpg" class="contained" alt='"An image of a graph. The x axis runs from -3 to 6 and the y axis runs from -3 to 6. The graph is of the function “f(x) = (1/x)”, a curved decreasing function. The graph of the function starts right below the x axis in the 4th quadrant and begins to decreases until it comes close to the y axis. The graph keeps decreasing as it gets closer and closer to the y axis, but never touches it due to the vertical asymptote. In the first quadrant, the graph of the function starts close to the y axis and keeps decreasing until it gets close to the x axis. As the function continues to decreases it gets closer and closer to the x axis without touching it, where there is a horizontal asymptote. There are also three horizontal orange lines plotted on the graph, each of which only runs through the function at one point."'></div>
