The first graph is of the function “f(x) = sin inverse(x)”, which is an increasing curve function. The function starts at the point (-1, -(pi/2)) and increases until it ends at the point (1, (pi/2)). The x intercept and y intercept are at the origin. The second graph is of the function “f(x) = cos inverse (x)”, which is a decreasing curved function. The function starts at the point (-1, pi) and decreases until it ends at the point (1, 0). The x intercept is at the point (1, 0). The y intercept is at the point (0, (pi/2)). The third graph is of the function f(x) = tan inverse (x)”, which is an increasing curve function. The function starts close to the horizontal line “y = -(pi/2)” and increases until it comes close the “y = (pi/2)”. The function never intersects either of these lines, it always stays between them - they are horizontal asymptotes. The x intercept and y intercept are both at the origin. The fourth graph is of the function “f(x) = cot inverse (x)”, which is a decreasing curved function. The function starts slightly below the horizontal line “y = pi” and decreases until it gets close the x axis. The function never intersects either of these lines, it always stays between them - they are horizontal asymptotes. The fifth graph is of the function “f(x) = csc inverse (x)”, a decreasing curved function. The function starts slightly below the x axis, then decreases until it hits a closed circle point at (-1, -(pi/2)). The function then picks up again at the point (1, (pi/2)), where is begins to decrease and approach the x axis, without ever touching the x axis. There is a horizontal asymptote at the x axis. The sixth graph is of the function “f(x) = sec inverse (x)”, an increasing curved function. The function starts slightly above the horizontal line “y = (pi/2)”, then increases until it hits a closed circle point at (-1, pi). The function then picks up again at the point (1, 0), where is begins to increase and approach the horizontal line “y = (pi/2)”, without ever touching the line. There is a horizontal asymptote at the “y = (pi/2)”."'></div>
