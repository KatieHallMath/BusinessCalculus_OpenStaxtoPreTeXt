<p>Sometimes we are not given the values of a function in table form, rather we are given the values in an explicit formula. Formulas arise in many applications. For example, the area of a circle of radius <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is given by the formula <span class="process-math">\(A(r)=\pi r^2.\)</span> When an object is thrown upward from the ground with an initial velocity <span class="process-math">\(v_0\)</span> ft/s, its height above the ground from the time it is thrown until it hits the ground is given by the formula <span class="process-math">\(s(t)=-16t^2+v_0 t.\)</span> When <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> dollars are invested in an account at an annual interest rate <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> compounded continuously, the amount of money after <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> years is given by the formula <span class="process-math">\(A(t)=Pe^{rt}.\)</span> Algebraic formulas are important tools to calculate function values. Often we also represent these functions visually in graph form.</p>
