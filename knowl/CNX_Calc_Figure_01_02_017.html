Both graphs have an x axis that runs from -2 to 4 and a y axis that runs from -2 to 5. The first graph is labeled “a” and is of two functions. The first graph is of two functions. The first function is “f(x) = square root of x”, which is a curved function that begins at the origin and increases. The second function is “f(x) = square root of 2x”, which is a curved function that begins at the origin and increases, but increases at a faster rate than the first function. The second graph is labeled “b” and is of two functions. The first function is “f(x) = square root of x”, which is a curved function that begins at the origin and increases. The second function is “f(x) = square root of (x/2)”, which is a curved function that begins at the origin and increases, but increases at a slower rate than the first function."'></div>
